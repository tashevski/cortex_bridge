## Consultation

### Consultation with the Person

| What was the person consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- |

### Consultation with Others

| Name, role and contact details | What were they consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gomez and Morticia Addams (Parents)** | Wednesday's lifelong pattern of social detachment and her apparent lack of interest in forming relationships, which they see as a strength but which is causing her problems in her new environment. | N/A |

## Other Sources of Information

*   **Clinical Interview** with Wednesday.

---

## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Wednesday is a highly intelligent and eccentric first-year university student. She is a gifted writer and musician (cello).
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Wednesday is exceptionally self-sufficient, resourceful, and has a powerful intellect. She is unflappable in a crisis. She aspires to be a successful detective novelist.
*   **Relevant social history:** Wednesday grew up in an unusual but loving and supportive family. She has always been a loner and has never had or desired close friendships.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Wednesday has a diagnosis of Schizoid Personality Disorder. This is a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings. She does not desire or enjoy close relationships, almost always chooses solitary activities, and takes pleasure in few, if any, activities. She shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Wednesday is highly articulate but her communication is formal, detached, and often morbid. She does not engage in small talk. It is important to respect her style and not to pressure her into emotional expression.
*   **Routine:** She has a highly structured and solitary routine.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Wednesday likes writing, playing her cello, conducting experiments, and visiting graveyards. She dislikes emotional displays, social gatherings, and most people.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Extreme social detachment and an apparent inability to experience pleasure (anhedonia). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The pattern is pervasive and lifelong. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. She has no friends and actively avoids all social contact. While this does not cause her distress in itself, the functional consequences (e.g., difficulty with mandatory group assignments at university) are causing problems. |
| **Setting events:** | Any situation that requires social interaction.
| **Triggers:** | Being forced to work in a group, someone trying to befriend her.
| **Risks:** | Complete social isolation, academic failure due to inability to participate in group work, being misunderstood or victimized due to her unusual presentation.
| **Maintaining factors:** | She finds social interaction to be unrewarding and difficult, so she avoids it, which prevents her from developing any social skills or relationships. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Wednesday has never had therapy before and is skeptical of its value.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** A strong innate preference for solitude, a possible neurodevelopmental difference.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The increased social demands of university life.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Her lack of social skills and her preference for solitude are mutually reinforcing.
*   **Protective factors:** Her high intelligence, her self-sufficiency, and her supportive family.

---

## Goals

*   To respect her desire for solitude while reducing its negative functional impact.
*   To learn and practice the functional social skills necessary for university success.
*   To find a way to connect with others based on shared interests, rather than emotional intimacy.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Social detachment | - Engage in individual therapy focused on social skills training in a very practical, goal-oriented way.<br>- Frame therapy as a way of learning the 'rules' of a game so she can achieve her own objectives.<br>- Do not set goals related to emotional connection or friendship, as these are not her goals.<br>- Identify structured, interest-based social groups where the focus is on an activity, not on socializing itself (e.g., a chess club, a creative writing group). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To learn and rehearse the functional behaviours required for group work. |
| **Rationale:** | To provide her with a concrete, logical set of rules and scripts to follow in a specific, problematic situation (mandatory group assignments), allowing her to achieve her academic goals with minimal discomfort. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Wednesday to break down the task of a group project into a series of concrete steps and social scripts. For example: 1) How to propose a division of labour. 2) A script for disagreeing with someone's idea politely. 3) A script for contributing her own ideas. They will role-play these scenarios. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The successful completion of her group assignments and the reduction in conflict with her group members. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending university, avoiding social contact where possible. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling stressed about an upcoming group project, expressing contempt for her classmates. | - This is a cue to practice her social skills scripts with her therapist.<br>- Reframe the task as a strategic challenge rather than an emotional one. |
| **Escalation:** Refusing to participate in a group, making morbid or intimidating comments to her classmates. | - The university may need to provide reasonable adjustments, such as allowing her to complete an alternative solo project where possible.<br>- Her therapist can help her to analyze the consequences of her behaviour (e.g., failing the class) from a purely pragmatic perspective. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Withdrawing completely from university. | - The focus would be on exploring alternative educational or vocational paths that are a better fit for her personality (e.g., distance education, a solitary research role). |
| **De-escalation:** N/A | N/A |
| **Recovery:** Successfully navigating a group project using her new skills. | - The therapist should analyze the success with her, reinforcing the utility of the skills she has learned. |
