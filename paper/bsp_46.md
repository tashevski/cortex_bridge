## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Travis is a lonely and isolated taxi driver who works nights. He is a former marine.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Travis has a strong sense of right and wrong, although it is rigid and idiosyncratic. He is disciplined and can be very focused. He aspires to clean up the world and to connect with someone who understands him.
*   **Relevant social history:** Travis is a veteran and has had difficulty adjusting to civilian life. He is estranged from his family and has no friends. He spends his spare time alone in his apartment or driving his taxi.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Travis has a diagnosis of Schizotypal Personality Disorder. This is a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behaviour. He has ideas of reference, odd beliefs or magical thinking, and suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Travis struggles to communicate his internal world. His speech can be vague and metaphorical. He benefits from a patient and non-judgmental therapist who can help him put words to his experiences.
*   **Routine:** He has a rigid routine of driving his taxi at night and spending his days alone.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Travis dislikes what he sees as the moral decay of society. It is unclear what he likes.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Social isolation, paranoid rumination, and a developing plan to commit an act of violence to 'cleanse' society. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The paranoid thoughts and ruminations are constant. |
| **Intensity:** | Extreme. He is at high risk of committing a serious violent act. |
| **Setting events:** | His ongoing loneliness and isolation.
| **Triggers:** | Seeing things on his taxi route that he interprets as evidence of moral decay (e.g., prostitution, crime).
| **Risks:** | Homicide, suicide, terrorism.
| **Maintaining factors:** | His social isolation prevents him from having his distorted beliefs challenged. His paranoid thinking provides a sense of meaning and purpose to his empty life. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Travis has no prior history of psychiatric treatment. He has no criminal record but has recently purchased several illegal firearms.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Possible trauma from his military service, an innately schizotypal personality structure.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Chronic loneliness and alienation.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The lack of any corrective social or relational input. The paranoid framework makes him feel powerful and knowledgeable rather than lonely and scared.
*   **Protective factors:** (Limited) His willingness to talk to a therapist, even if his motivations for doing so are unclear.

---

## Goals

*   The immediate goal is to reduce the risk of violence.
*   To build a therapeutic alliance and engage him in treatment.
*   To reduce his paranoid ideation.
*   To find safe and pro-social ways for him to feel a sense of meaning and purpose.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Violent ideation | - Engage in individual psychotherapy with a focus on building a strong, trusting therapeutic alliance.<br>- Gently and collaboratively explore the evidence for and against his paranoid beliefs.<br>- Use medication (antipsychotics) to reduce the intensity of the paranoid ideation.<br>- Explore his feelings of loneliness and alienation that are underneath the anger.<br>- Work to find one safe, structured social activity (e.g., a veterans' group, a volunteer role). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To reality-test his ideas of reference. |
| **Rationale:** | To gently challenge his belief that random events are personally directed at him, which fuels his paranoia and anger. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Travis to identify a specific belief (e.g., 'Those people laughing on the corner are laughing at me'). They will then work together, as co-detectives, to look for alternative explanations and evidence that contradicts the belief (e.g., 'What else could they be laughing at? Did they even look at you?'). The goal is to introduce doubt and cognitive flexibility. |
| **Reinforcement:** | A reduction in his own feelings of distress and anger when he is able to consider an alternative explanation. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending therapy, taking medication. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Increased rumination about societal decay, talking more about the need for 'action'. | - Increase the frequency of therapy sessions.<br>- Focus on the feelings of anger and powerlessness that are driving the thoughts.<br>- A medication review may be necessary. |
| **Escalation:** Talking about a specific plan for violence, attempting to acquire more weapons. | - This is a psychiatric emergency. The therapist has a duty to warn and protect.<br>- This may require notification of the police and involuntary hospitalization. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Attempting to carry out an act of violence. | - This is a police matter. |
| **De-escalation:** N/A | N/A |
| **Recovery:** Following a hospitalization or police intervention. | - The focus will be on re-engaging him in treatment and ensuring community safety. |
