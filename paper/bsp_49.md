## Consultation

### Consultation with the Person

| What was the person consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ron was consulted after his ex-wife expressed concerns to his GP about his increasing isolation and mistrust. Ron attended the appointment reluctantly, stating that 'therapy is a scam'. | N/A |

### Consultation with Others

| Name, role and contact details | What were they consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diane Lewis (Ex-wife)** | Ron's long-standing pattern of mistrust, his belief that others are trying to exploit him, and his refusal to share personal information with anyone. | N/A |

---

## Other Sources of Information

*   **GP Report** (noting refusal of routine health checks).
*   **Collateral interview** with his ex-wife.

---

## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Ron is a highly competent and self-sufficient director of a government department, a position he holds with great irony given his libertarian beliefs. He is an expert woodworker and outdoorsman.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Ron is extremely self-reliant, practical, and has a strong, unwavering moral code. He aspires to be left alone to live his life as he sees fit.
*   **Relevant social history:** Ron had a very self-sufficient upbringing in a small, rural community. He has been married twice, and both relationships ended due to his emotional unavailability and mistrust.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Ron has a diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder. He has a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are interpreted as malevolent. He suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving him, and is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against him.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Ron is direct and laconic. He does not express emotion and is very guarded. Building trust is the primary and most difficult task in any therapeutic relationship.
*   **Routine:** He has a very predictable and self-contained routine.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Ron likes woodworking, hunting, fishing, breakfast food, and privacy. He dislikes the government, sharing personal information, and emotional displays.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Social withdrawal, refusal of preventative medical care, bearing grudges, and hostile, angry reactions to perceived slights. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The underlying suspiciousness is pervasive and constant. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate to Severe. His refusal of medical care puts his physical health at risk. His inability to trust has led to the breakdown of all his intimate relationships. |
| **Setting events:** | Any situation that requires him to rely on others or to be vulnerable.
| **Triggers:** | A perceived betrayal, someone asking him personal questions, a doctor recommending a medical test.
| **Risks:** | Severe social isolation, relationship failure, undetected medical conditions, potential for litigation against others due to his belief he has been wronged.
| **Maintaining factors:** | His cognitive style of looking for and finding evidence that confirms his suspicions. His self-reliance means he never has to test his belief that others will let him down. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Ron has never had therapy and is highly resistant to the idea. He is only attending due to pressure from his ex-wife.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Likely a combination of temperament and early experiences that taught him that relying on others is unsafe.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Any situation that requires trust or vulnerability.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** His suspiciousness keeps people at a distance, which he then interprets as proof that they are untrustworthy.
*   **Protective factors:** His competence and self-reliance mean he functions well in many areas of life. He has a few people he trusts to a limited degree.

---

## Goals

*   To build a therapeutic alliance based on trust and respect for his autonomy.
*   To reduce the negative impact of his suspiciousness on his health and relationships.
*   To gently challenge his black-and-white thinking about trust.
*   To agree to undergo basic, necessary medical screenings.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Suspiciousness and hostility | - The therapist must be scrupulously honest, reliable, and consistent.<br>- Therapy should be framed as a collaboration between two experts.<br>- Focus on the pragmatic, real-world negative consequences of his behaviour (e.g., 'Your refusal to see a doctor could lead to you being unable to go hunting').<br>- Do not directly challenge his beliefs, but gently explore the evidence for and against them. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To develop a more nuanced view of trust. |
| **Rationale:** | To challenge the all-or-nothing belief that people are either 100% trustworthy or 100% untrustworthy. The goal is to help him see that trust can be domain-specific and partial. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Ron to identify the very few people he does trust (e.g., his ex-wife, his colleague). They will analyze *why* he trusts them and in what specific domains. The goal is to establish a model of 'evidence-based trust' rather than blind faith or global mistrust. For example, 'I can trust my ex-wife to be honest, but I can't trust her not to meddle'. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The improved quality of his relationships when he is able to place a small amount of trust in someone. The practical benefits of seeking medical care. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending therapy, though reluctantly. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Becoming more guarded, asking questions about the therapist's motives, cancelling appointments. | - Address this directly and non-defensively ('I notice you seem more wary today. Has something happened to make you question our work?').<br>- Reiterate the confidential nature of the therapy. |
| **Escalation:** Accusing the therapist or someone else of having malicious motives, becoming angry and hostile. | - Stay calm and do not become defensive. This will be seen as proof of guilt.<br>- Do not argue the point. Instead, state your own position calmly ('My intention is to help you with the goals we agreed on').<br>- End the session if he is becoming too hostile. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Cutting off contact with someone (including the therapist) due to a perceived betrayal. | - The therapist may attempt one contact (e.g., a letter) reiterating their position and leaving the door open for him to return.<br>- It is not possible to force him to re-engage. |
| **De-escalation:** N/A | N/A |
| **Recovery:** He decides to re-engage in a relationship or in therapy. | - Do not dwell on the rupture, but welcome him back.<br>- It may be possible, over time, to analyze the misunderstanding that led to the rupture. |
