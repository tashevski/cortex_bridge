## Consultation

### Consultation with the Person

| What was the person consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fiona was consulted about her long and complex medical history and the distress it causes her. The consultation was framed around managing her overall wellbeing, as she does not have insight into the factitious nature of her illness. | N/A |

### Consultation with Others

| Name, role and contact details | What were they consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Fiona is a former nurse who is currently on a disability pension. She is highly knowledgeable about medical terminology and procedures.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Fiona is intelligent, articulate, and can be very charming and engaging. She is resilient in the face of countless medical procedures.
*   **Relevant social history:** Fiona had a difficult childhood with a history of neglect. She has few social supports and her identity is heavily invested in being a 'patient'.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Fiona has a diagnosis of Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self (Munchausen Syndrome). She presents to others as ill, impaired, or injured by feigning or inducing symptoms. This behaviour occurs in the absence of obvious external rewards.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Fiona communicates well but the content is almost exclusively focused on her medical symptoms. It is important to listen and show empathy for her distress, without reinforcing the illness behaviour.
*   **Routine:** Her routine revolves around medical appointments, managing her 'symptoms', and researching illnesses.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Fiona enjoys the attention and care she receives in a medical setting. She dislikes being discharged from hospital or being told there is 'nothing wrong'.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury or disease. (e.g., tampering with wound dressings to cause infection, manipulating blood sugar readings). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The behaviour is ongoing and has persisted for over a decade. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. The behaviour has led to numerous invasive and life-threatening medical procedures, surgeries, and hospital admissions. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling ignored, lonely, or unimportant.
| **Triggers:** | A recent discharge from hospital, a doctor questioning the legitimacy of her symptoms.
| **Risks:** | Severe iatrogenic harm (illness caused by medical treatment), permanent injury or death from self-induced illness, organ damage.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The psychological reinforcement of assuming the sick role (receiving care, attention, and sympathy), the thrill of deceiving medical professionals. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Fiona has a 15-year history of unexplained medical issues and dozens of hospital admissions across different states. The diagnosis of Factitious Disorder was only recently made after a multi-disciplinary case conference.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** History of childhood neglect, personality disorder traits, previous career as a nurse.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Feelings of emptiness and a lack of identity outside of the 'patient' role.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The reinforcement received from medical staff and the lack of other coping mechanisms for emotional distress.
*   **Protective factors:** Her underlying physical resilience, the new coordinated care plan.

---

## Goals

*   The primary goal is to reduce and eliminate the risk of iatrogenic harm.
*   To manage the behaviour through a single, coordinated care team, reducing 'doctor shopping'.
*   To gently and gradually engage Fiona in psychotherapy to address the underlying emotional needs.
*   To find alternative sources of meaning and self-worth outside of the sick role.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Illness deception | - Establish a single GP as the gatekeeper for all medical care.<br>- The GP and psychologist to have regular case conferences.<br>- Focus on 'caring, not curing'. Provide regular, scheduled appointments that are not dependent on new symptoms.<br>- Avoid confrontation about the deception. Instead, focus on the distress the symptoms are causing.<br>- Gently introduce psychotherapy focusing on coping with chronic illness (as a bridge to addressing the underlying disorder). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To identify and label emotional states and connect them to the urge to engage in illness behaviour. |
| **Rationale:** | To help Fiona develop insight that the urge to feign illness is often a response to an intolerable emotional state (e.g., loneliness, feeling invisible), rather than a physical problem. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Fiona to explore the feelings she has just before a 'flare-up'. They will use journaling and emotion-labelling exercises. The goal is to build a new narrative: 'When I feel lonely, I have the urge to make myself sick to go to the hospital'. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The therapist's empathy and validation for the underlying emotional pain is the key reinforcement. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Engaging with GP and psychologist, not currently in hospital. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Increased talk of a new or worsening symptom, researching new illnesses. | - Acknowledge her distress ('That sounds very worrying').<br>- Encourage her to discuss it at her next scheduled GP appointment.<br>- Gently explore what else is happening in her life ('It sounds like things are very stressful at the moment'). |
| **Escalation:** Presenting to a hospital emergency department with a new, dramatic symptom. | - The hospital's plan is to contact the primary GP immediately.<br>- The focus should be on conservative management and avoiding invasive tests unless absolutely medically necessary and confirmed by the primary team. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Evidence of active self-induced injury (e.g., tampering with an IV line). | - The immediate priority is medical safety.<br>- This requires a careful medical and psychiatric review, potentially including a period of one-on-one nursing observation. |
| **De-escalation:** The medical crisis resolves, she is stable. | - The focus returns to care, not confrontation.<br>- The team would express relief that she is safe. |
| **Recovery:** Discharged from hospital. | - A follow-up appointment with the psychologist and GP should be scheduled promptly.<br>- The focus is on processing the distress of the hospital admission, not on the deception itself. |
