## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Stealing items from shops. The items are typically of little value and are hoarded or thrown away. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The impulse and behaviour can occur in episodes, often 1-2 times a month. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe, due to the legal and social consequences. She has multiple convictions for shoplifting. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling stressed, depressed, or empty. Having unstructured and unsupervised time in a retail environment. |
| **Triggers:** | Seeing a particular item, the 'opportunity' to take something without being seen. |
| **Risks:** | Criminal conviction, imprisonment, loss of employment, family breakdown. |
| **Maintaining factors:** | The feeling of tension before the act, and the feeling of pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft. The impulse is ego-dystonic (she feels guilty afterwards). |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Chloe has been arrested for shoplifting on three occasions. Previous interventions have included fines and community service, but she has not previously engaged in psychological therapy for the issue.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Co-occurring depression, possible neurobiological factors related to impulse control.
*   **Precipitating factors:** High levels of stress, feelings of emptiness or depression.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The reinforcing cycle of tension and relief associated with the act.
*   **Protective factors:** Strong motivation to change, supportive husband, successful career.

---

## Goals

*   To completely cease all stealing behaviour.
*   To develop alternative coping strategies for managing stress, depression, and urges.
*   To address the underlying emotional issues contributing to the behaviour.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Stealing | - Engage in regular CBT with a focus on impulse control.<br>- Avoid going to shops alone, especially during high-risk times.<br>- Leave credit cards and large bags at home to reduce temptation and opportunity.<br>- Create a 'relapse prevention plan' identifying triggers and coping strategies. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use covert sensitization and other impulse control techniques. |
| **Rationale:** | To break the link between the impulse and the behaviour by associating the urge to steal with negative consequences, rather than the feeling of relief. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The therapist will teach Chloe covert sensitization, where she learns to imagine the urge to steal and then immediately imagines a negative consequence in vivid detail (e.g., being caught, the look on her husband's face, being led away in handcuffs). She will also learn to delay the impulse and use competing behaviours. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The primary reinforcement is the avoidance of legal consequences and the reduction of guilt and shame. Praise from her therapist and husband for her efforts is also key. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Not stealing, attending therapy. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Increased feelings of depression or stress, having thoughts about going to a shop alone. | - Immediately contact her therapist or husband as per her support plan.<br>- Engage in a positive, alternative activity (e.g., go for a run, call a friend).<br>- Use her CBT skills to challenge the permissive thoughts. |
| **Escalation:** Feeling a strong urge or tension to steal while in a shop. | - Leave the situation immediately. Do not purchase anything.<br>- Use the covert sensitization technique she has practiced.<br>- Call her support person. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Having stolen an item. | - Immediately enact the part of her plan that deals with a lapse. This must be discussed and agreed upon with her therapist and legal advisors (e.g., whether to return the item).<br>- Be honest with her therapist and husband. |
| **De-escalation:** The immediate crisis of the act is over. | - Focus on processing the lapse without shame or blame.<br>- Analyze the chain of events that led to the behaviour. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Re-commit to her therapy and support plan.<br>- Identify what can be learned from the lapse to strengthen her relapse prevention plan. |
