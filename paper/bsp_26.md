## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Helen is a retired primary school teacher and a devoted grandmother. She was very active and social before the onset of her symptoms.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Helen is caring, articulate, and determined. She is desperate to find a solution to her symptoms and to be able to play with her grandchildren again.
*   **Relevant social history:** The onset of Helen's symptoms followed a viral illness five years ago. While the initial illness resolved, the pain and fatigue have persisted and worsened.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Helen has a diagnosis of Somatic Symptom Disorder. She has one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing and result in significant disruption of daily life. She has excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviours related to these symptoms (e.g., disproportionate thoughts about their seriousness, high levels of health anxiety, and excessive time and energy devoted to them).
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Helen's conversation is dominated by her physical symptoms. It is important to validate that her symptoms are real and cause genuine distress, while gently shifting the focus from finding a cure to improving function.
*   **Routine:** Her routine is very limited and is dictated by her symptoms. She spends a lot of time resting.
*   **Sensory needs:** She is hyper-vigilant to physical sensations in her body.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Helen likes reading and spending quiet time with her husband. She used to love gardening and walking. She dislikes feeling dismissed by doctors and the fact that her body has 'let her down'.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Excessive preoccupation with symptoms, frequent doctor visits, reassurance seeking, and severe avoidance of physical activity. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The preoccupation and avoidance are constant and daily. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. Helen has become almost completely housebound. Her world has shrunk to her home and the doctor's surgery. |
| **Setting events:** | A poor night's sleep, a new or different physical sensation.
| **Triggers:** | Reading about illnesses on the internet, hearing about someone else being sick, trying to do a physical activity.
| **Risks:** | Severe deconditioning from inactivity, social isolation, depression, iatrogenic harm from unnecessary medical procedures.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The belief that the symptoms are a sign of a serious, undiagnosed disease. The temporary relief from anxiety after a doctor provides reassurance. The fear that activity will make the symptoms worse. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Helen has seen numerous specialists over the past five years. All tests have failed to find a medical explanation for the severity of her symptoms. She has been resistant to psychological explanations until now.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** History of anxiety, tendency to be highly attuned to bodily sensations.
*   **Precipitating factors:** An acute viral illness.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Catastrophic interpretation of symptoms, avoidance of activity leading to deconditioning, the reinforcing cycle of reassurance seeking.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive husband, good relationship with her GP, a stated desire to re-engage with life.

---

## Goals

*   To shift the focus from finding a cure to improving daily function and quality of life.
*   To reduce health-related anxiety and reassurance-seeking behaviours.
*   To gradually increase physical activity and re-engage in valued life activities.
*   To learn to manage symptoms using cognitive and behavioural strategies.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Preoccupation and avoidance | - Engage in CBT for somatic symptom disorders.<br>- Validate that the symptoms are real, while explaining the role of the central nervous system in amplifying them.<br>- Reduce and eventually stop searching for medical information online.<br>- Schedule and pace activities, starting with very small, manageable steps. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use activity pacing and graded exposure to increase physical activity. |
| **Rationale:** | To break the 'boom-bust' cycle of overdoing it on a good day and then crashing. This helps to gradually increase tolerance for activity without exacerbating symptoms, thereby challenging the belief that activity is harmful. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will help Helen to establish a baseline of her current activity tolerance. They will then create a structured plan to increase the duration of an activity (e.g., walking) by a very small amount (e.g., 1 minute) each day or every few days, regardless of how she feels. The key is consistency, not intensity. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Keeping a log to see her own progress is a powerful reinforcer. Praise from her husband and therapist for sticking to the plan, not for how she feels, is crucial. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Following the pacing plan, functioning at a basic level. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Increased focus on a symptom, starting to worry it's something new. | - Acknowledge the sensation without judgment.<br>- Use CBT skills to challenge the catastrophic thought ('What is a more likely explanation for this feeling?').<br>- Redirect attention to an engaging external activity. |
| **Escalation:** High level of anxiety, wanting to call the doctor or go to the emergency room. | - Validate the fear ('I know this feeling is very frightening for you').<br>- Review the agreement made with the GP about when to seek medical advice.<br>- Encourage her to 'wait and see' for an agreed period (e.g., 2 hours) while using distraction and coping skills. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A 'flare-up' of symptoms, leading to being bed-bound and distressed. | - Do not increase attention or reassurance for the symptoms.<br>- Focus on comfort and using calming strategies.<br>- Gently encourage sticking to the baseline level of activity as much as possible (e.g., getting out of bed for meals). |
| **De-escalation:** The flare-up subsides. | - Avoid lengthy discussions about the symptoms themselves. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Review what triggered the flare-up.<br>- Problem-solve how to manage that trigger in the future.<br>- Re-commit to the graded activity plan. |
