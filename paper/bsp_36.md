## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Eleanor is a sales representative who is very successful at her job. She is the life of the party, has many acquaintances, but very few close or lasting friendships.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Eleanor is energetic, charming, and socially skilled. She can be very entertaining and engaging. She aspires to be loved and admired.
*   **Relevant social history:** Eleanor grew up in a family where she only received attention when she was being dramatic or entertaining. She has a history of intense but short-lived romantic relationships.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Eleanor has a diagnosis of Histrionic Personality Disorder. She shows a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking. She is uncomfortable in situations in which she is not the center of attention, her interactions are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behaviour, and she shows rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Her speech is often impressionistic and lacking in detail. She can be highly dramatic and emotional. It is important for the therapist to maintain boundaries and not get drawn into the drama.
*   **Routine:** Her routine is often chaotic and driven by her social life and romantic interests.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Eleanor likes parties, being the center of attention, and excitement. She dislikes being alone, being ignored, and situations that are not focused on her.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Impulsive decisions (e.g., quitting jobs, ending relationships), using suicidal gestures or threats to gain attention or manipulate others, and engaging in risky behaviours to feel excitement. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The attention-seeking is constant. The impulsive and risky behaviours are more likely during periods of stress, particularly following a relationship breakdown. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate to Severe. Suicidal gestures, while not intended to be fatal, carry a real risk of accidental death. Impulsive decisions have led to financial and occupational instability. |
| **Setting events:** | A relationship ending, feeling bored or ignored.
| **Triggers:** | A partner or friend paying attention to someone else, not being the focus of a conversation.
| **Risks:** | Accidental self-harm, relationship breakdown, financial instability, sexually transmitted infections from risky behaviour.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The temporary validation and attention she receives for her dramatic behaviour. The avoidance of feelings of inner emptiness. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Eleanor has had several brief courses of therapy in the past, usually following a crisis, but has not engaged in long-term treatment. She is seeking help now due to a depressive episode.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Childhood experiences where attention was contingent on performance.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A perceived rejection or abandonment, especially in a romantic context.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The attention from others reinforces the behaviour. The lack of a core sense of self means she relies on external validation.
*   **Protective factors:** Intelligence, social skills, her current distress is motivating her to seek change.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce impulsive and risky behaviours, including suicidal gestures.
*   To develop a stronger sense of self-worth that is not dependent on external attention.
*   To improve the quality and stability of her interpersonal relationships.
*   To learn to identify and express emotions in a more nuanced and less dramatic way.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Attention-seeking and impulsivity | - Engage in long-term, insight-oriented psychotherapy.<br>- Focus on identifying the underlying feelings of emptiness and the fear of being ignored.<br>- Practice mindfulness to increase awareness of her internal states.<br>- Develop a crisis plan for managing suicidal urges that focuses on self-soothing rather than contacting others. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To develop a core sense of self by identifying personal values and interests. |
| **Rationale:** | To build a stable identity so that her self-esteem is not solely dependent on the attention and approval of others, which will reduce the need for dramatic and attention-seeking behaviour. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Eleanor to explore her own genuine interests, values, and beliefs, separate from what she thinks will impress others. This may involve trying new hobbies on her own, journaling, and values clarification exercises. The goal is to help her answer the question, 'What do I actually like and believe in?' |
| **Reinforcement:** | The internal feeling of authenticity and self-respect. Praise from the therapist for genuine self-reflection, rather than for dramatic stories. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Engaging in therapy, showing some self-reflection. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling an intense need to be the center of attention, feeling bored or empty. | - Use mindfulness to sit with the uncomfortable feeling without immediately acting on it.<br>- Engage in one of the value-based activities she has identified for herself.<br>- Use a journal to explore the feeling. |
| **Escalation:** Making provocative or dramatic statements, becoming excessively emotional. | - The therapist's role is to remain calm and not get drawn into the drama.<br>- Gently reflect the underlying feeling ('It sounds like you are feeling very hurt right now').<br>- Maintain the boundaries of the session. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Making a suicidal gesture or threat. | - Follow the crisis plan. This involves assessing the immediate risk.<br>- If risk is high, facilitate contact with emergency services.<br>- If risk is assessed as a manipulative gesture, the plan may involve a calm response that does not provide excessive attention, such as, 'We have agreed that when you feel this way, you will use your self-soothing skills. We can talk about it in our next session.' This must be carefully assessed by a professional. |
| **De-escalation:** Calming down. | - Focus on the precipitating event and the underlying feelings. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Process the incident in therapy, focusing on what she can learn about her patterns and how she can meet her needs in more adaptive ways. |
