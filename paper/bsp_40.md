## Consultation

### Consultation with the Person

| What was the person consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- |
| Olivia was consulted about her feelings, particularly her 'big angry feelings', using stories, drawings, and play-based activities. | N/A |

### Consultation with Others

| Name, role and contact details | What were they consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maria and Carlos Martinez (Parents)** | The history of Olivia's explosive outbursts, which are out of proportion to the trigger, and their feelings of being unable to manage them. | N/A |
| **School Teacher** | The impact of the outbursts in the classroom and on her peer relationships. | N/A |

---

## Other Sources of Information

*   **Paediatrician and Neurologist Reports** (ruling out other conditions like epilepsy).
*   **Parent and Teacher Rating Scales** (assessing for ADHD, ODD, and anxiety).

## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Olivia is a creative and energetic girl who loves animals and dancing. Most of the time, she is a happy and cooperative child.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Olivia is bright, funny, and can be very caring. She feels very remorseful after her outbursts.
*   **Relevant social history:** There is no history of trauma or abuse. The outbursts seem to have no clear starting point and have been present for several years.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Olivia has a diagnosis of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). She exhibits recurrent behavioural outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses. These outbursts are grossly out of proportion to any provocation and are not premeditated. Between outbursts, she is at her developmental baseline.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Olivia has good communication skills but cannot access them during an outburst. She is unable to be reasoned with when she is escalating.
*   **Routine:** Outbursts are more likely when she is tired or overstimulated.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted, but can become overwhelmed in chaotic environments.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Olivia likes dancing, drawing, and playing with her friends. She dislikes being told 'no', making mistakes, and feeling frustrated.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Explosive outbursts of verbal aggression (screaming, shouting) and physical aggression (hitting, kicking, throwing objects). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Occur on average twice a week. The outburst itself is usually brief (less than 30 minutes). |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. The aggression is impulsive and rage-like. She has broken things and caused minor injuries (bruises) to her parents. |
| **Setting events:** | Fatigue, hunger, a busy or noisy environment.
| **Triggers:** | Minor frustrations that other children would manage, such as losing a game, being told to wait, or making a mistake in her schoolwork.
| **Risks:** | Injury to self or others, damage to property, social rejection by peers, school suspension.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The neurobiological difficulty in impulse control and affect regulation. The behaviour is not goal-oriented (she isn't trying to get anything). |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Parents have tried many different discipline strategies, which have not been effective and have sometimes made the situation worse. They are seeking help as the outbursts are becoming more powerful as she gets older.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Likely neurobiological. A difficulty in the brain's ability to regulate anger.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A frustrating event.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The cycle of the outburst providing a release of tension, followed by parental attention.
*   **Protective factors:** A loving and supportive family, her own remorse and desire to be 'good'.

---

## Goals

*   To eliminate aggressive and destructive outbursts.
*   To teach Olivia skills to recognize and manage her anger.
*   To teach parents skills to de-escalate potentially explosive situations.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Explosive outbursts | - Engage in a therapy model that focuses on skill-building for the child and parents (e.g., CBT, Collaborative & Proactive Solutions).<br>- Help Olivia to identify the early warning signs of her anger ('My volcano is rumbling').<br>- Practice 'anger-dousing' strategies when she is calm (e.g., deep breathing, going to a calm-down corner).<br>- Parents to focus on de-escalation and safety, rather than discipline, during an outburst. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To identify anger triggers and use a planned coping strategy. |
| **Rationale:** | To give Olivia a sense of control over her 'big feelings' and to provide a clear, practiced alternative to an explosive outburst. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Olivia and her parents to create a 'My Anger Plan'. They will use a feelings thermometer to help her rate her anger from 1-5. They will identify what a '1' feels like and what a '5' (the explosion) feels like. They will then practice what she can do when she feels her anger is at a '2' or '3' (e.g., say 'I need a break', go to her calming corner, squeeze a stress ball). |
| **Reinforcement:** | Intense praise and positive attention for using her anger plan. The feeling of successfully managing her anger without an explosion is a powerful natural reinforcer. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Calm and regulated. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. Lots of praise for good behaviour. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Becoming frustrated, clenching fists, using an angry tone of voice. (Anger at a 2-3). | - This is the crucial intervention point.<br>- Prompt her to use her Anger Plan ('This looks like a 3 on your thermometer. What's on your plan?').<br>- Reduce demands and provide space. |
| **Escalation:** Shouting, screaming, starting to throw things. (Anger at a 4). | - The window for teaching is closed. The focus is now 100% on safety and de-escalation.<br>- Use a calm, quiet voice. Say as little as possible.<br>- Remove other people from the room. Ensure the environment is safe. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Full, rageful outburst. Hitting, kicking, destroying property. (Anger at a 5). | - **SAFETY FIRST.** Do not try to physically restrain her. Use therapeutic crisis intervention techniques if trained (e.g., maintaining a safe distance, using a calm stance).<br>- The goal is to let the 'storm' pass with minimal engagement. |
| **De-escalation:** The rage subsides, she becomes tearful and exhausted. | - Do not lecture or punish her. She already feels terrible.<br>- Offer comfort and reassurance ('That was a big storm. You're safe now'). |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Much later, when everyone is calm, you can briefly process the event ('Your anger volcano erupted today. Next time, let's try to use your plan when it's just rumbling').<br>- Focus on repairing the relationship. |
