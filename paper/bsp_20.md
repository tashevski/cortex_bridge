## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Lily is a bright and cheerful little girl who loves her parents, her cat, and drawing. At home, she is a chatterbox who sings and tells stories. However, she does not speak at all in kindergarten or to people she doesn't know well.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Lily is intelligent, observant, and has excellent non-verbal communication skills. She is very expressive through her art.
*   **Relevant social history:** Lily lives with her supportive parents. There is no history of trauma or abuse. Her parents report she was a shy toddler but the not-speaking became more pronounced when she started kindergarten.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Lily has a diagnosis of Selective Mutism. This is an anxiety disorder where a child is unable to speak in certain social situations, despite being able to speak comfortably in other settings.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Lily communicates non-verbally in feared situations. It is crucial not to pressure her to speak. She can use gestures, pointing, or a whiteboard to communicate her needs.
*   **Routine:** Predictable routines, especially at the start of the day or in social settings, help to lower her anxiety.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Lily likes drawing, playing with her cat, and being with her parents. She dislikes being the center of attention, being asked direct questions in a group, and new social situations.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Inability to speak in specific social situations (e.g., kindergarten). This can manifest as 'freezing' or appearing withdrawn. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Consistently does not speak in kindergarten and with unfamiliar adults/children. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. Her inability to speak impacts her ability to make friends, participate in class, and communicate her basic needs (e.g., if she is hurt or needs the toilet). |
| **Setting events:** | Any social setting outside of her immediate family home. |
| **Triggers:** | Being asked a direct question, being expected to participate verbally in a group activity. |
| **Risks:** | Social isolation, bullying, academic difficulties, development of other anxiety disorders. |
| **Maintaining factors:** | The anxiety itself, the relief from anxiety when the pressure to speak is removed, and others speaking for her. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

The behaviour was first noted when Lily started kindergarten 18 months ago. The family is now starting a behavioural therapy program focused on stimulus fading and graded exposure.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Anxious temperament, possible genetic predisposition to anxiety.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The social demands of kindergarten.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The anxiety response becomes a conditioned habit. Well-meaning adults may inadvertently reinforce the mutism by rescuing her from the situation or speaking for her.
*   **Protective factors:** Strong and supportive family, intelligence.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce Lily's anxiety in social situations.
*   To increase Lily's verbal communication, starting with whispering and progressing to normal speech.
*   To improve Lily's social engagement and ability to form friendships.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Not speaking in social settings | - Educate parents and school staff about Selective Mutism as an anxiety disorder, not defiance.<br>- Use a 'stimulus fading' approach: have Lily practice speaking with her parents, and then gradually introduce a new person (e.g., the teacher) into the room.<br>- Create a 'brave talking' ladder (graded exposure hierarchy) of communication goals.<br>- Avoid pressuring Lily to speak. Instead of questions, use comments ('I see you are drawing a dog'). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use a 'brave talking' ladder to gradually increase verbal communication. |
| **Rationale:** | To break down the overwhelming task of 'talking' into small, manageable, and achievable steps, which builds confidence and reduces anxiety. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist, parents, and teacher will work together to create the ladder. Steps might include: 1) Mouthing a word to a parent in front of the teacher. 2) Whispering a word. 3) Whispering a sentence. 4) Using a normal voice. This is practiced in short, fun sessions. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Small, frequent rewards (e.g., a sticker, a special activity) will be given for achieving a step on the ladder. Praise should be specific and focused on the effort ('I love how you tried to whisper that word!'). |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Chatty and relaxed at home. | Refer to the proactive strategies section for work in feared settings. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** In a social setting, she becomes still, avoids eye contact, 'freezes'. | - Do not pressure her to speak. Reduce demands.<br>- Acknowledge her feelings non-verbally ('It can be a bit scary with new people').<br>- Engage her in a non-verbal activity she enjoys (e.g., drawing). |
| **Escalation:** Becomes tearful or tries to hide if pressure to speak continues. | - Immediately remove the pressure to speak.<br>- Offer comfort and a way to communicate non-verbally (e.g., 'Can you point to what you need?'). |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A full anxiety response (crying, shaking). | - Move her to a quiet, safe space with a trusted adult (parent).<br>- Provide comfort and reassurance. |
| **De-escalation:** Calming down. | - Do not discuss the incident or the lack of talking.<br>- Re-engage in a calming, preferred activity. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Later, review the situation with the adults involved to see if the demands were too high.<br>- Adjust the 'brave talking' ladder if needed. |
