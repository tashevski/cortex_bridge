## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Rachel is a fashion buyer who is very good at her job. She is social, has good friends, but her life is increasingly dominated by her health fears.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Rachel is bright, articulate, and motivated to get help for her anxiety. She hopes to be able to live her life without constantly worrying about her health.
*   **Relevant social history:** Rachel's grandmother died of cancer when Rachel was a teenager, and this was a very formative and frightening experience for her.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Rachel has a diagnosis of Illness Anxiety Disorder. She has a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. She performs excessive health-related behaviours (e.g., repeatedly checks her body) and exhibits maladaptive avoidance.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** She is very articulate about her fears. It is important not to provide reassurance about her health status, but to validate the anxiety she feels.
*   **Routine:** Her routine is frequently interrupted by her need to check her body, research symptoms online, or visit a doctor.
*   **Sensory needs:** She is hypervigilant to normal, benign bodily sensations (e.g., a headache, a muscle twitch), which she misinterprets as a sign of serious illness.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Rachel likes fashion, socializing with friends, and travelling. She dislikes uncertainty, any discussion of illness, and feeling bodily sensations she can't explain.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Repetitive body checking, researching symptoms online for hours, frequent doctor visits, and avoidance of things she associates with illness (e.g., hospitals, news stories about health). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The checking and researching behaviours occur daily, often for several hours. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. The preoccupation is causing significant distress and is impairing her social and occupational functioning. |
| **Setting events:** | Hearing about someone else being sick, an upcoming medical appointment (even for a check-up).
| **Triggers:** | Noticing a benign bodily sensation (e.g., a mole, a stomach gurgle), a health-related news article.
| **Risks:** | Iatrogenic harm from unnecessary tests or procedures, significant financial cost, severe anxiety, development of depression.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The catastrophic misinterpretation of benign symptoms. The temporary (but short-lived) relief that comes from reassurance-seeking (e.g., a doctor saying she is fine, finding a non-threatening explanation online). |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

The health anxiety began after her grandmother's death but has become much more severe in the past two years. She has not had any previous psychological treatment.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** History of a family member with a serious illness, anxious temperament.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A stressful life event that increased her general anxiety levels.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The reinforcing cycle of checking and reassurance-seeking, which reduces anxiety in the short term but increases it in the long term.
*   **Protective factors:** Good insight into the excessive nature of the anxiety, strong social support, motivation for therapy.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce and eliminate excessive body checking and online symptom research.
*   To reduce reassurance-seeking from doctors, friends, and family.
*   To develop a more realistic and less threatening interpretation of benign bodily sensations.
*   To reduce avoidance of health-related stimuli.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Checking and reassurance seeking | - Engage in CBT for Health Anxiety.<br>- Schedule a single, regular check-up with her GP (e.g., every 6 months) and agree not to make appointments in between unless for an acute, observable issue.<br>- Implement 'response prevention': actively resist the urge to check her body or look up symptoms online.<br>- Create a 'worry period': schedule 15 minutes each day to focus on her health worries, and postpone any worries until that time. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To challenge and reality-test her catastrophic thoughts about her health. |
| **Rationale:** | To break the habit of automatically interpreting a benign sensation as a sign of a terminal illness. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will teach Rachel to treat her thoughts as hypotheses, not facts. She will learn to identify a feared thought (e.g., 'This headache is a brain tumour') and then act as a detective to examine the actual evidence for and against it. She will generate and write down alternative, more probable explanations (e.g., 'I am dehydrated', 'I slept funny'). |
| **Reinforcement:** | The reduction in her own anxiety when she generates and believes a more realistic thought is the primary reinforcer. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Managing anxiety, reducing checking. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Noticing a new sensation, feeling the urge to Google it. | - Immediately engage in response prevention. Do not Google.<br>- Use the thought-challenging skills to assess the sensation realistically.<br>- Engage in a distracting activity for at least 20 minutes. |
| **Escalation:** Becoming convinced that the sensation is a sign of a serious illness, feeling high anxiety. | - Validate the feeling, not the content ('I know this is very scary for you').<br>- Strongly encourage her to resist the urge to seek reassurance.<br>- Use relaxation or mindfulness exercises to tolerate the anxiety. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Making an emergency appointment with the GP or presenting to an emergency room. | - The GP has a plan to provide a brief, standard check-up and then gently but firmly refuse to order further tests, redirecting her back to her psychology treatment plan. |
| **De-escalation:** The anxiety subsides after a period of time without checking or reassurance. | - This is a successful exposure trial. Praise her for her courage in tolerating the uncertainty and anxiety. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Analyze the trigger and the success of her coping strategies.<br>- Reinforce her ability to get through the episode without resorting to old behaviours. |
