## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Emma is a talented web designer who works from home. She is married and has a cat named Mittens.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Emma is creative, intelligent, and has a strong desire to overcome her agoraphobia. She dreams of being able to travel with her husband.
*   **Relevant social history:** Emma's agoraphobia developed after she experienced a series of unexpected panic attacks in a crowded shopping centre two years ago.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Emma has a diagnosis of Agoraphobia. She fears and avoids situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms. The situations (e.g., leaving home, being in a crowd, using public transport) are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Emma communicates well but her conversation is dominated by her anxiety. She needs to feel in control of the pace of her treatment.
*   **Routine:** Her routine is entirely home-based. Her husband does all the shopping and errands.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Emma likes reading, watching movies, and coding. She dislikes feeling trapped, being far from home, and the physical sensations of panic.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Complete avoidance of leaving the house alone. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Constant. She has not left her house alone for over a year. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. Her life is extremely restricted. She is completely dependent on her husband for any interaction with the outside world. |
| **Setting events:** | The thought of having to go somewhere.
| **Triggers:** | Being asked to leave the house, or even just thinking about it.
| **Risks:** | Severe social and occupational impairment, depression, complete loss of independence.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The avoidance of feared situations prevents her from learning that her fears are unfounded. The safety behaviours (e.g., only going out with her husband) reinforce the idea that she cannot cope alone. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Emma has had no previous treatment for her agoraphobia. She has been managing her life by working from home and relying on her husband.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Anxious temperament.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A series of unexpected panic attacks in public.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The powerful reinforcement of anxiety reduction that comes from avoidance. Catastrophic misinterpretation of panic symptoms.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive husband, insight into the irrationality of her fear, high motivation to change.

---

## Goals

*   To be able to leave the house alone and travel independently.
*   To reduce and eliminate panic attacks.
*   To re-engage with social and recreational activities outside the home.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Avoidance of leaving home | - Engage in CBT with a focus on graded exposure and response prevention.<br>- Develop a detailed, hierarchical list of feared situations, from easiest (e.g., standing on the front porch for 1 minute) to hardest (e.g., going to the shopping centre alone).<br>- Learn and practice cognitive skills to challenge catastrophic thoughts about panic.<br>- Learn and practice breathing and relaxation skills to manage anxiety. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use graded exposure to systematically confront feared situations. |
| **Rationale:** | To break the cycle of avoidance and to provide her with new learning experiences that her brain is not in danger and that she can cope with the feelings of anxiety. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Emma to create a 'fear ladder'. Emma will start with the lowest step and practice it repeatedly until her anxiety reduces. She will then move to the next step. The key is that the exposure is planned, prolonged (she must stay in the situation until anxiety decreases), and practiced without safety behaviours (like calling her husband). |
| **Reinforcement:** | The sense of achievement and mastery from completing a step on the ladder is the primary reinforcer. Praise from her husband and therapist is also important. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** At home, feeling anxious about exposure tasks. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling anxious before a planned exposure exercise, having thoughts of cancelling. | - Acknowledge the anxiety as a normal part of the process ('anticipatory anxiety').<br>- Review the cognitive skills she has learned ('What's the worst that could happen? Can I cope with it?').<br>- Remind her of her goals. |
| **Escalation:** Experiencing high anxiety or a panic attack during an exposure task. | - Stay in the situation. Do not flee. This is the most critical part of the therapy.<br>- Use the breathing and coping skills she has practiced.<br>- Remind herself that the panic attack is not dangerous and will pass. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Intense fear, strong urge to escape back to the safety of home. | - 'Ride the wave' of panic. Notice the sensations without judgment.<br>- Focus on the external environment rather than internal sensations. |
| **De-escalation:** The panic or high anxiety subsides while still in the situation. | - This is a successful trial. She should stay in the situation for a little longer to consolidate the new learning.<br>- Praise herself for her courage and for sticking with it. |
| **Recovery:** Returning home after a successful exposure. | - Have a period of relaxation.<br>- Record the success in her therapy diary, noting that her feared catastrophe did not happen. |
