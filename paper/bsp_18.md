## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Leo is a witty and intelligent teenager who is passionate about history and politics. He has a great sense of humour and is known for his quick comebacks.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Leo is highly articulate, knowledgeable, and resilient. He hopes to become a journalist or a politician.
*   **Relevant social history:** Leo lives with his parents and has a strong family support system. He has found it difficult to make friends due to the social stigma associated with Tourette's.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Leo has been diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic. He also has diagnoses of ADHD and OCD.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Leo is highly verbal, but his vocal tics (e.g., throat clearing, sniffing, occasional words) can interrupt his speech. He benefits from people being patient and not drawing attention to his tics.
*   **Routine:** Stress and fatigue can worsen Leo's tics, so a balanced routine is important.
*   **Sensory needs:** Leo can experience a premonitory urge (an uncomfortable physical sensation) before a tic, which is relieved by performing the tic.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Leo likes debating, reading, and watching documentaries. He dislikes being stared at, being told to 'stop it', and feeling like he is not in control of his own body.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Complex motor tics that can be self-injurious (e.g., hitting himself) or socially inappropriate (e.g., copropraxia - obscene gestures). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Self-injurious tics occur infrequently, usually when under extreme stress. Socially inappropriate tics are more common. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate. The tics can cause bruising and lead to significant social difficulties. |
| **Setting events:** | Stress, anxiety, fatigue, excitement. |
| **Triggers:** | Being in a quiet environment (e.g., library, exam room), social scrutiny. |
| **Risks:** | Physical injury, social isolation, bullying, school disciplinary action. |
| **Maintaining factors:** | The involuntary nature of the tics, the temporary relief from the premonitory urge. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Leo's tics started when he was 6 years old. He was diagnosed with Tourette's at age 10. He is currently undergoing Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT).

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Genetic and neurological factors.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Stress, heightened emotional states.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The neurobiological urge to tic, negative reactions from others.
*   **Protective factors:** High intelligence, strong family support, a good sense of humour.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce the frequency and severity of tics that cause pain or significant social impairment.
*   To increase Leo's sense of control over his tics.
*   To educate others about Tourette's Syndrome to foster a more accepting environment.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Harmful or disruptive tics | - Continue with Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT).<br>- Educate school staff and peers about Tourette's Syndrome.<br>- Provide a quiet space at school where Leo can go to release his tics if needed.<br>- Implement strategies for managing stress and anxiety (e.g., regular exercise, relaxation techniques). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use a competing response to manage his tics. |
| **Rationale:** | To provide him with an active strategy to manage his tics, rather than just suppressing them. This is a core component of CBIT. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | Leo will work with his therapist to identify a specific tic he wants to work on. He will become aware of the premonitory urge and then learn to perform a specific behaviour (the competing response) that is physically incompatible with the tic (e.g., for a head-jerking tic, the competing response might be to gently tense his neck muscles). |
| **Reinforcement:** | Success in managing the tic and praise from his therapist and parents will serve as reinforcement. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Tics are present but manageable. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Increase in premonitory urges, feeling more stressed or anxious. | - Prompt Leo to use his competing response strategies.<br>- Encourage him to take a break or use a relaxation technique. |
| **Escalation:** A 'tic attack' or a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of tics. | - Remain calm and ignore the tics as much as possible.<br>- Reduce environmental stress (e.g., move to a quieter area).<br>- Do not tell him to stop ticcing. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Tics are causing self-injury or significant distress. | - Ensure his immediate safety.<br>- Offer support and reassurance. |
| **De-escalation:** Tics begin to subside. | - Allow him time to recover without pressure.<br>- Offer a calming activity. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Briefly discuss any potential triggers.<br>- Re-engage with his routine and CBIT practice. |
