## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Alice is the host of a DID system. She is a kind and caring librarian who loves books and her husband. The system also includes other alters, including a child alter ('Lily', age 6), a protector alter ('Jax', age 19), and an internal self-helper.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** The system as a whole is highly creative, resilient, and intelligent. They aspire to achieve better internal cooperation and to live a more stable and fulfilling life.
*   **Relevant social history:** Alice has a history of severe, repeated childhood trauma that led to the development of DID.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Alice has a diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder. This is characterized by identity fragmentation rather than a proliferation of separate personalities. The system experiences amnesia, depersonalization, and derealization.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Communication can be complex. Sometimes Alice is present, other times an alter is 'fronting'. It is important to be respectful and to ask who is present if unsure. The system benefits from a calm, predictable, and safe environment.
*   **Routine:** A predictable routine is crucial for stability and reducing unwanted switching.
*   **Sensory needs:** Some alters are sensitive to specific triggers (e.g., loud noises, certain smells) that are linked to past trauma.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** These vary significantly between alters. Alice enjoys reading, while Lily enjoys drawing and Jax enjoys listening to loud music.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Self-harm, impulsive actions (run by younger alters), and significant memory loss leading to unsafe situations. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | High-risk behaviours are most likely during periods of extreme stress or when triggered. Memory loss is a daily occurrence. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. There is a history of serious self-harm attempts by some alters. |
| **Setting events:** | Anniversaries of traumatic events, interpersonal conflict, high stress. |
| **Triggers:** | Trauma-related stimuli (e.g., seeing an abuser, specific locations, smells, sounds). |
| **Risks:** | Serious injury or death, accidental harm due to memory loss (e.g., leaving the stove on), relationship breakdown. |
| **Maintaining factors:** | The dissociative structure itself, which is a coping mechanism for overwhelming trauma. Lack of internal communication and cooperation. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Alice has been in therapy for DID for three years. The focus of therapy is on the three-phase model: 1) Safety and stabilization, 2) Trauma processing, and 3) Integration and rehabilitation.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Severe, chronic childhood trauma; innate dissociative capacity.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Trauma triggers, high stress.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Ongoing dissociation, amnesia between alters, internal conflict.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive husband, therapeutic relationship, intelligence and creativity of the system.

---

## Goals

*   To establish and maintain physical and emotional safety for all parts of the system.
*   To improve communication and cooperation among alters.
*   To reduce amnesia and dissociative symptoms.
*   To process traumatic memories in a safe and therapeutic manner.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Self-harm, dissociation, internal conflict | - Adherence to phase-oriented therapy for DID.<br>- Use a system journal for internal communication.<br>- Create a 'safe place' visualization for grounding.<br>- Develop a detailed crisis plan that all alters are aware of.<br>- Practice grounding techniques to stay in the present moment. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use grounding techniques to manage dissociation and stay present. |
| **Rationale:** | To help the system stay connected to the present and reduce the likelihood of unwanted switching or losing time, which is a primary safety concern. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The therapist will teach a variety of grounding techniques (e.g., 5-4-3-2-1 sensory exercise, holding a grounding object, noticing the environment). Alice and her alters will practice these skills both in and out of sessions. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Increased feelings of safety, control, and being present are the primary reinforcers. Praise from the therapist and husband is also important. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Good internal communication, stable mood. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling 'spacey', increased headaches, hearing more internal chatter. | - Encourage use of grounding techniques.<br>- Suggest journaling or internal communication to see what is causing the distress.<br>- Reduce external stress if possible. |
| **Escalation:** A switch occurs, an alter is distressed or acting impulsively. | - Stay calm. Address the alter who is present by name if known.<br>- Orient them to the present time and place ('It's 2025, you are safe in your home').<br>- Refer to the crisis plan. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** An alter is engaging in self-harm or is highly distressed and disoriented. | - Ensure immediate safety. Call for emergency help if needed, as per the crisis plan.<br>- Use a calm, reassuring voice. Do not try to force a switch back to the host. |
| **De-escalation:** The system is stabilizing, the distressed alter has calmed down. | - Offer comfort and support.<br>- Encourage journaling about the experience for later therapeutic work. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline, Alice is present again. | - Gently discuss what happened, acknowledging the amnesia she may have.<br>- Review triggers and the effectiveness of the response. |
