## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Walter is a brilliant but frustrated high school chemistry teacher. He was recently diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Walter is a genius-level chemist, is highly intelligent, and a meticulous planner. His aspiration is to provide for his family after his death, but this has become distorted.
*   **Relevant social history:** Walter co-founded a successful technology company but was bought out for a small sum before it became worth billions, leaving him with a deep sense of resentment and failure. He has always been a mild-mannered and conflict-avoidant man until his diagnosis.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Walter has a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. This is a maladaptive reaction to an identifiable stressor (his terminal diagnosis) that involves mood disturbance, anxiety, and a disturbance of conduct that is out of proportion to the stressor.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Walter has become secretive and deceitful. He struggles to express his feelings of fear and vulnerability, instead expressing them as anger and a need for control.
*   **Routine:** His previous routine has been completely disrupted by his diagnosis and his subsequent choices.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Walter likes chemistry, order, and feeling respected. He dislikes feeling powerless, disrespected, and out of control.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Engaging in extremely risky and illegal activities, lying to his family, manipulating others, and aggressive outbursts. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The behaviours began shortly after his diagnosis and have escalated rapidly. |
| **Intensity:** | Extreme. His behaviour poses a grave risk of harm to himself and others, and has significant legal and social consequences. |
| **Setting events:** | His terminal diagnosis, his feelings of resentment and powerlessness.
| **Triggers:** | Feeling disrespected, his plans being challenged, feeling like he is losing control.
| **Risks:** | Physical harm or death to self or others, imprisonment, destruction of his family.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The sense of power and control he gets from his secret life, which is a powerful antidote to the powerlessness he feels about his cancer. The financial rewards. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Walter has no prior history of such behaviour. This is a dramatic and sudden change in his personality and actions, precipitated by his diagnosis.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Long-standing feelings of resentment and underachievement.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The terminal cancer diagnosis, which represents the ultimate loss of control.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The success of his risky behaviours, the sense of power it gives him, the secrecy preventing him from seeking healthier coping strategies.
*   **Protective factors:** His underlying love for his family, his intelligence.

---

## Goals

*   To help Walter find a more adaptive way to cope with his diagnosis.
*   To improve communication with his family.
*   To reduce his engagement in risky and illegal behaviours.
*   To help him find a sense of meaning and control in the final stage of his life that is not destructive.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Risky/Controlling Behaviour | - Engage in counselling focused on grief, loss, and existential issues related to his diagnosis.<br>- Facilitate family therapy sessions to improve open and honest communication.<br>- Encourage him to use his skills in a pro-social way (e.g., legacy building, tutoring chemistry).<br>- Explore ways he can have genuine control over his end-of-life choices through advance care planning. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To express feelings of fear, vulnerability, and anger in a direct and safe way. |
| **Rationale:** | To provide an alternative to acting out these feelings through destructive behaviour. By giving his emotions a voice, he reduces the need to express them through action. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Walter to identify and label his feelings. They will use techniques from supportive psychotherapy to help him talk about his fears of death, his regrets, and his anger at the injustice of his situation. The therapist's role is to tolerate and validate these powerful emotions. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The sense of relief from sharing the emotional burden. The improved intimacy and connection with his wife when he is honest with her. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending therapy, communicating more openly with his wife. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Becoming more secretive, irritable, spending more time on his own. | - His wife can use 'I' statements to express her concern ('I'm worried about you when you become quiet like this. I'm here to listen').<br>- The therapist can explore his feelings of wanting to withdraw. |
| **Escalation:** A major lie is exposed, or he has an angry, controlling outburst. | - Do not engage in a power struggle.<br>- His wife's role is to state the boundary calmly ('I will not be spoken to like that. We can talk again when you are ready to be respectful').<br>- The natural consequences (e.g., his wife's withdrawal) are the most powerful response. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** He is discovered to be engaging in highly dangerous or illegal activity. | - The safety of the family is the priority.<br>- This may require his wife to take actions she finds very difficult, such as contacting the authorities, as per her own safety plan. |
| **De-escalation:** The crisis has passed. | - The focus is on the consequences of his actions. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - The incident must be processed in therapy, focusing on the choice he made and the underlying feelings that drove it. |
