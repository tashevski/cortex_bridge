## About the Person

*   **All about me:** David is a retired accountant who lives with his wife. He has two adult children.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** David is intelligent, reliable, and was very dedicated to his work. He has a dry sense of humour. He hopes to one day feel happy again.
*   **Relevant social history:** David describes himself as having been a 'serious' and 'pessimistic' person for most of his life. The symptoms have been present for many years, but have worsened since his retirement.
*   **Disability and health needs:** David has a diagnosis of Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). This is a chronic form of depression where a depressed mood is present for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least two years. He also experiences low energy, low self-esteem, and feelings of hopelessness.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** David can be quiet and withdrawn. He often responds to questions with negativity or pessimism. It is important to be patient and gently challenge his negative thinking patterns.
*   **Routine:** His routine is very limited. He spends most of his time at home watching television.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** David used to enjoy fishing and gardening. He now states that he doesn't enjoy anything.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Social withdrawal, inactivity, and persistent negative thinking (rumination). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The behaviours are present daily and have been for many years. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate. While not acutely suicidal, his quality of life is very poor. There is a risk of developing a major depressive episode on top of his dysthymia ('double depression'). |
| **Setting events:** | Unstructured time, being alone.
| **Triggers:** | Minor setbacks or disappointments, which he interprets as further evidence of his hopelessness.
| **Risks:** | Severe functional impairment, social isolation, marital problems, potential for developing major depression or suicidal ideation.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The inactivity and withdrawal reduce any opportunity for positive experiences. The persistent negative thinking reinforces his depressed mood. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

David has never previously sought treatment for his mental health. He has always believed that this is 'just the way he is'.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Pessimistic personality style, possible genetic factors.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The loss of role and routine following retirement.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The cycle of inactivity and negative thinking, which feed off each other.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive wife, financial stability, no substance use issues.

---

## Goals

*   To improve David's mood and reduce his symptoms of depression.
*   To increase his level of activity and re-engagement with previously enjoyed hobbies.
*   To challenge his negative automatic thoughts and core beliefs.
*   To improve his marital satisfaction.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Withdrawal and inactivity | - Engage in evidence-based therapy, such as CBT or Interpersonal Therapy (IPT).<br>- Use 'behavioural activation': schedule one small, planned activity each day, even if he doesn't feel like it.<br>- Start with activities that provide a sense of mastery (e.g., fixing something small) before moving to pleasure.<br>- Keep a log of activities and rate his mood before and after to test his belief that nothing will help. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use behavioural activation to increase activity levels. |
| **Rationale:** | To break the vicious cycle where depression leads to inactivity, which in turn worsens the depression. By acting 'from the outside in' and changing his behaviour first, his mood and thoughts are likely to follow. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will explain the rationale for behavioural activation. Together, they will create a hierarchy of activities, from very easy (e.g., walk to the letterbox) to more difficult (e.g., go fishing for an hour). David will schedule one activity per day and commit to doing it, regardless of his motivation level. The focus is on the action, not the feeling. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Tracking his progress and seeing the link between activity and small improvements in mood is the key reinforcer. Praise from his wife and therapist for his efforts is also important. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Low mood, but adhering to the behavioural activation plan. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Refusing to do his scheduled activity, spending more time in bed, increased negative self-talk. | - Acknowledge the difficulty ('I know it feels impossible today').<br>- Use problem-solving: Can the activity be broken down into an even smaller step?<br>- Gently remind him of the principle: 'Act according to the plan, not the mood'. |
| **Escalation:** Expressing feelings of complete hopelessness, stating that the therapy is not working. | - Validate his feelings of hopelessness ('It sounds like you feel completely stuck right now').<br>- Avoid getting into an argument. Instead, focus on the data from his own activity logs ('Let's look at the record. Last Tuesday you did X, and your mood went from a 2 to a 4').<br>- Discuss these feelings with his psychologist. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Expressing passive suicidal ideation ('I wish I just didn't wake up'). | - Take this seriously. All expressions of suicidal ideation must be explored.<br>- Ask directly about active suicidal plans.<br>- Implement the safety plan, which may involve contacting his GP or a crisis team. |
| **De-escalation:** The intense feelings of hopelessness subside. | - Offer support and reassurance. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Review the trigger for the increase in hopelessness.<br>- Re-commit to the therapy plan. This may require a medication review with his GP. |
