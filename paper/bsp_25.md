## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Daniel is a construction manager, a husband, and a father of two. He is a hard worker and is seen as reliable and competent by his colleagues.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Daniel is a skilled project manager and is very dedicated to his family. He feels immense guilt and remorse after his outbursts and is motivated to change.
*   **Relevant social history:** Daniel grew up in a household where his father had a similar temper. He has no other significant mental health history.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Daniel has a diagnosis of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). This is characterized by recurrent behavioural outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses, which are grossly out of proportion to the provocation.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Daniel is articulate but can become defensive when discussing his anger. He benefits from a direct, skills-based approach.
*   **Routine:** The outbursts are not routine but are triggered by specific provocations.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Daniel likes fishing, watching football, and spending time with his children. He dislikes feeling disrespected, things not going to plan, and his own aggressive behaviour.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, shouting) and physical aggression toward property (e.g., punching walls, breaking objects). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Outbursts occur approximately once or twice a month. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. The outbursts are frightening for his family and have resulted in significant property damage. |
| **Setting events:** | Work stress, fatigue, financial pressure.
| **Triggers:** | Feeling criticized or disrespected, minor frustrations (e.g., traffic jam, a mistake by a colleague), his children not listening.
| **Risks:** | Injury to self (e.g., punching a wall), relationship breakdown, job loss, legal charges.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The behaviour is not premeditated and is impulsive. There is a sense of release or relief during the outburst, followed by intense regret. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

The behaviour has been present for many years but has worsened with increasing life stressors. A recent incident involving breaking a door led to police involvement and a court order to attend an anger management program.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Growing up with an aggressive role model, possible neurobiological predisposition to impulsivity.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A specific trigger or provocation.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Poor emotional regulation skills, the habit of responding to frustration with anger.
*   **Protective factors:** Motivation to change, supportive (though fearful) wife, stable employment.

---

## Goals

*   To eliminate all aggressive and destructive outbursts.
*   To learn to recognize early warning signs of anger.
*   To develop and implement effective anger management and communication skills.
*   To repair relationships damaged by the aggressive behaviour.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Aggressive outbursts | - Attend a structured anger management program based on CBT principles.<br>- Identify and monitor physiological and cognitive triggers for anger.<br>- Practice stress reduction techniques (e.g., exercise, mindfulness).<br>- Improve assertive communication skills to express frustration appropriately. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use a 'time-out' procedure for anger de-escalation. |
| **Rationale:** | To interrupt the anger cycle before it escalates to an explosive outburst by physically removing himself from the triggering situation, allowing him to calm down and think more clearly. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | Daniel will work with his psychologist and his wife to create a clear time-out plan. This involves: 1) Recognizing the early warning signs of anger. 2) Communicating the need for a time-out in a pre-agreed way ('I need to take a break'). 3) Going to a pre-agreed separate space for a set period (e.g., 20 minutes). 4) Using calming strategies during the time-out. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The successful prevention of an outburst is the main reinforcer. Positive feedback from his wife for using the strategy is also crucial. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Calm, using skills. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling hot, clenching fists, heart racing, having thoughts like 'I can't believe this'. | - Immediately implement the time-out procedure.<br>- Use deep breathing or other relaxation skills.<br>- Challenge the angry thoughts. |
| **Escalation:** Raising his voice, starting to swear. | - This is the critical point. He MUST take a time-out now.<br>- His wife's role is to disengage and remind him of the plan ('It looks like now is a good time for that break'). |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A full explosive outburst (yelling, throwing things, punching walls). | - The immediate priority is safety. His wife and children should move to a safe part of the house or leave if necessary, as per their safety plan.<br>- Do not engage with him or argue with him during the outburst. |
| **De-escalation:** The outburst ends, he is calming down. | - Allow him space. He will likely be feeling very guilty and ashamed. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Once everyone is calm, the incident must be discussed. He needs to take responsibility for the outburst and any damage caused.<br>- Review the chain of events to see where the plan broke down and how it can be improved. |
