## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Avoidance of feared situations | - Educate Liam about the nature of panic attacks and the role of avoidance.<br>- Develop a hierarchy of feared situations to guide exposure therapy.<br>- Practice relaxation and breathing techniques to manage anxiety.<br>- Challenge his catastrophic thoughts about panic attacks. |

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use interoceptive exposure to reduce his fear of panic sensations. |
| **Rationale:** | To help Liam to learn that the physical sensations of panic are not dangerous and that he can tolerate them without having a full-blown panic attack. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | Liam will work with his psychologist to deliberately induce the physical sensations of panic in a safe and controlled environment. He will learn to tolerate these sensations without resorting to avoidance or safety behaviours. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Positive reinforcement will be provided for successfully completing interoceptive exposure exercises. |
