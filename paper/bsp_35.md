## Consultation

### Consultation with the Person

| What was the person consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- |
| Leo was consulted about his fascination with fire and his feelings. The consultation used play-based techniques and focused on building rapport, as he was initially reluctant to discuss the fire-setting. | N/A |

### Consultation with Others

| Name, role and contact details | What were they consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anna and Max Bloom (Parents)** | The history of the fire-setting incidents, Leo's general behaviour, and family stressors. | N/A |
| **Fire and Rescue NSW** | A fire safety officer was consulted to provide a home safety assessment and education for the family. | N/A |

---

## Other Sources of Information

*   **Police Report** (regarding a fire in a park rubbish bin).
*   **School Report** (noting social difficulties and some oppositional behaviour).

## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Leo is a quiet and often withdrawn boy who has difficulty making friends. He is very interested in how things work.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Leo is intelligent and curious. He responds well to one-on-one attention from adults.
*   **Relevant social history:** Leo has been bullied at school. His parents have been going through a period of high conflict and are currently separated.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Leo has a diagnosis of Pyromania. This involves deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion. He experiences tension or affective arousal before the act and feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or witnessing their aftermath. He has a fascination with fire and its situational contexts.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Leo struggles to express his emotions verbally, particularly anger and distress. He often says 'I don't know' when asked how he feels.
*   **Routine:** He lacks a predictable routine due to the current family separation.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Leo likes building complex models and watching science documentaries. He dislikes school and social gatherings.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Deliberate fire setting, typically in secluded areas (e.g., setting fire to leaves in the backyard, rubbish in a park bin). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | There have been three known incidents in the past six months. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe to Extreme. The potential for a fire to spread and cause catastrophic property damage or loss of life is extreme. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling angry, powerless, or distressed, particularly after witnessing his parents arguing or being bullied at school. Being unsupervised.
| **Triggers:** | Access to ignition materials (lighters, matches).
| **Risks:** | Severe injury or death to self or others, major property damage, criminal charges.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The intense feeling of power, control, and relief he gets from setting and watching the fire, which provides a powerful distraction from his emotional pain. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

The parents were unaware of the first two minor incidents. The most recent incident in a park was reported to the police, which triggered this intervention.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Difficulty with emotional expression, social difficulties, possible trauma from parental conflict.
*   **Precipitating factors:** An episode of intense emotional distress (e.g., anger, humiliation).
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The powerful reinforcing (pleasure/relief) properties of the fire-setting behaviour.
*   **Protective factors:** Parents are now aware and highly motivated to address the issue.

---

## Goals

*   To ensure the immediate and ongoing safety of Leo and the community by eliminating all fire-setting behaviour.
*   To secure all ignition materials in the home.
*   To teach Leo alternative, safe ways to express and manage his difficult emotions.
*   To improve family communication and reduce conflict.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fire setting | - **Absolute priority: Environmental Safety.** All lighters, matches, and flammable materials must be locked away and inaccessible.<br>- Leo is not to be left unsupervised, especially during times of distress.<br>- Engage in family therapy to address parental conflict and improve communication.<br>- Engage Leo in individual therapy to work on emotion regulation and social skills.<br>- Provide fire safety education from a trained professional. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To identify feelings of anger and distress and use a safe, alternative coping strategy. |
| **Rationale:** | To provide Leo with a safe and effective way to manage the intense feelings that trigger the fire-setting urge, breaking the link between distress and dangerous behaviour. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will help Leo to identify the physical signs of anger/distress (e.g., feeling hot, clenched fists). They will create a 'What to do when I feel fiery' plan. This might include energetic activities (e.g., punching a punching bag, running on the spot) or calming activities (e.g., ripping up paper, squeezing ice cubes, listening to loud music). |
| **Reinforcement:** | Praise from parents and the therapist for using his safe strategies. The natural reduction in his own distress from using the strategies effectively. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Not engaging in fire-related behaviour. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. Maintain high levels of supervision. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Becoming quiet and withdrawn after a stressful event, trying to be alone, asking about lighters/matches. | - This is a high-risk situation. Increase supervision immediately.<br>- Gently try to engage him about his feelings ('I can see you seem upset about what happened').<br>- Prompt him to use one of his 'fiery feelings' strategies.<br>- Do not leave him unsupervised. |
| **Escalation:** He has obtained a lighter or is attempting to start a fire. | - Intervene immediately and calmly.<br>- Remove the ignition source without a struggle if possible. State the rule clearly: 'We don't play with fire. It is not safe.' |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A fire has been lit. | - **SAFETY FIRST.** Immediately extinguish the fire if safe to do so. Evacuate the area and call 000 if it is not immediately controllable.<br>- Ensure Leo and everyone else is safe. |
| **De-escalation:** The immediate danger is over. | - Once calm, the incident needs to be processed.<br>- There must be a clear and significant consequence for the fire-setting, such as the loss of a major privilege. This needs to be explained calmly. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - The incident must be discussed in detail in family and individual therapy.<br>- Review how he was able to access ignition materials and strengthen the environmental safety plan. |
