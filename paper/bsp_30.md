## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Hannah is a postgraduate law student. She is a high achiever and is very dedicated to her studies.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Hannah is intelligent, hardworking, and articulate. She is ashamed of her eating disorder and is highly motivated to recover.
*   **Relevant social history:** Hannah was a competitive gymnast during her teenage years, a sport with a strong focus on weight and body shape. The binge-purge cycle began after she stopped gymnastics and went to university.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Hannah has a diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa. She has recurrent episodes of binge eating, followed by recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours (in her case, self-induced vomiting) in order to prevent weight gain. Her self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Hannah is open and honest in therapy but feels a great deal of shame. A collaborative and non-judgmental approach is essential.
*   **Routine:** Her daily routine is highly structured around her studies, but this is frequently disrupted by binge-purge episodes.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Hannah likes studying, debating, and running. She dislikes feeling out of control, feeling full after eating, and social events that involve food.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Episodes of binge eating (eating a large amount of food in a discrete period while feeling a loss of control), followed by self-induced vomiting. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Binge-purge episodes occur, on average, 3-4 times per week. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. The episodes are very distressing and are associated with significant medical risks. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling stressed or emotionally distressed (e.g., after an exam, after an argument), breaking a dietary rule.
| **Triggers:** | Being alone in the evening, having access to binge foods.
| **Risks:** | Severe electrolyte disturbances (which can cause cardiac arrest), dental erosion, damage to the esophagus, dehydration, depression, and anxiety.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The cycle of dietary restriction leading to binge eating. The temporary reduction in anxiety about weight gain after purging. The use of the behaviour to cope with difficult emotions. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

The behaviour has been present for six years. Hannah has previously tried to manage it on her own but is now starting evidence-based CBT for Bulimia Nervosa (CBT-BN).

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Perfectionistic personality traits, past involvement in an aesthetic sport.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Strict dieting and dietary restriction.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The binge-purge cycle itself, the over-evaluation of shape and weight, mood intolerance.
*   **Protective factors:** High motivation, intelligence, good insight, supportive family.

---

## Goals

*   To eliminate binge eating and purging behaviours.
*   To establish a regular pattern of eating (3 meals and 2-3 snacks per day).
*   To reduce the over-evaluation of shape and weight as a measure of self-worth.
*   To develop alternative strategies for managing difficult emotions.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Binge eating and purging | - Engage in CBT-BN.<br>- Self-monitor eating patterns, urges, and behaviours in real time.<br>- Establish a regular pattern of eating to eliminate the dietary restriction that triggers binges.<br>- Identify and schedule alternative, pleasurable activities.<br>- Develop a plan for managing high-risk times (e.g., evenings). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use problem-solving and alternative coping strategies when experiencing a difficult emotion or the urge to binge. |
| **Rationale:** | To break the link between emotional distress and the binge-purge cycle by developing a toolkit of more adaptive coping mechanisms. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | Hannah will work with her psychologist to identify the specific triggers and functions of her binge eating (e.g., 'When I feel lonely, I binge to numb the feeling'). They will then brainstorm a list of alternative actions she can take instead (e.g., call a friend, have a bath, listen to a podcast, use a relaxation exercise). She will create a 'coping card' to carry with her. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The sense of mastery and control from successfully managing an urge without bingeing is the key reinforcer. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Following a regular eating pattern, not bingeing or purging. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Having thoughts about dieting, feeling an urge to binge. | - Use the problem-solving and coping skills plan.<br>- Delay the behaviour: 'I will wait 20 minutes, and then I can reconsider'.<br>- Engage in an activity that is incompatible with eating (e.g., go for a walk, call someone). |
| **Escalation:** A binge-eating episode has started. | - The goal is to interrupt the cycle. Even if a binge has started, she can still make the choice not to purge.<br>- Remind herself that the feeling of fullness will pass and does not automatically lead to weight gain. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A full binge-purge episode has occurred (a lapse). | - This is a lapse, not a relapse. It is a predictable part of recovery.<br>- Do not engage in further restriction the next day, as this will trigger another binge.<br>- Analyze the chain of events that led to the lapse in her self-monitoring record. |
| **De-escalation:** The episode is over. | - Engage in a self-compassionate and calming activity.<br>- Rehydrate with water. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Get back to the regular pattern of eating at the next meal or snack.<br>- Discuss the lapse with her psychologist to identify what can be learned. |
