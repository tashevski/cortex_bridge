## About the Person

*   **All about me:** James is a highly successful and respected senior architect. He is known for his meticulous attention to detail and his high standards.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** James is hardworking, reliable, and has a strong moral compass. He is committed to producing high-quality work.

This is a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. (Note: This is distinct from OCD).

*   **Routine:** His life is dominated by rigid schedules, lists, and rules.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** James likes order, rules, and control. He dislikes inefficiency, mess, and people who do not share his high standards.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Perfectionism that interferes with task completion, excessive devotion to work, rigidity and stubbornness, and an inability to delegate. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The behaviours are pervasive and constant across all areas of his life. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. His perfectionism means that projects are often delayed. His rigidity has destroyed his relationships with his work colleagues and is causing significant marital stress. |
| **Setting events:** | A complex project with many variables, working with others who have different styles.
| **Triggers:** | A colleague making a mistake, a change to a plan, a situation where he cannot control the outcome.
| **Risks:** | Job loss, marital breakdown, social isolation, chronic stress and anxiety.
| **Maintaining factors:** | His core belief that 'if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself'. The temporary anxiety reduction that comes from checking and re-checking his work. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

James has never had therapy before. He does not see his personality style as the problem, but rather the failure of others to live up to his standards.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Possible genetic predisposition, upbringing that emphasized perfection and criticized mistakes.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Being promoted to a senior management role that requires flexibility and delegation.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The professional success he has had (in some areas) reinforces his belief that his way is the only right way. His behaviour alienates others, which then confirms his belief that he cannot rely on them.
*   **Protective factors:** High intelligence, genuine desire to be a good architect, his wife is still supportive but is encouraging him to change.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce the negative impact of his perfectionism on his work and relationships.
*   To learn to delegate tasks effectively.
*   To increase his cognitive flexibility and his ability to see other perspectives.
*   To improve his work-life balance.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Perfectionism and rigidity | - Engage in long-term psychotherapy, likely psychodynamic or schema-focused, to understand the origins of his beliefs.<br>- Use CBT techniques to challenge the all-or-nothing thinking associated with perfectionism.<br>- Conduct behavioural experiments to test his beliefs (e.g., delegate a small task and see if the world ends).<br>- Schedule leisure and family time and treat it with the same importance as work. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To conduct behavioural experiments to challenge his rigid beliefs. |
| **Rationale:** | To provide him with direct, concrete evidence that his catastrophic predictions (e.g., 'If I delegate this, it will be a disaster and I will be shamed') are not accurate. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will help James to identify a specific belief he wants to test. They will design an experiment, with a clear prediction. For example: 'I will delegate the drafting of the weekly report to my junior. I predict the report will be filled with errors and I will have to redo it anyway.' He then carries out the experiment and they review the actual result, comparing it to his prediction. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The time and mental energy he saves by delegating. The improved morale in his team. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Engaging in therapy, considering new perspectives. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Becoming overly focused on a minor detail, criticizing a colleague's work, taking work home every night. | - This is a point for self-reflection. He can use a journal to ask himself: 'Is this an example of my perfectionism taking over? What is the cost of this behaviour?'<br>- Refer back to the results of his behavioural experiments. |
| **Escalation:** Becoming angry and critical when a colleague makes a mistake, refusing to let anyone else contribute to a project. | - This is a situation where colleagues or his spouse need to set boundaries.<br>- Use 'I' statements ('When you re-do all my work, I feel demoralized').<br>- Do not get into a debate about who is 'right'. Focus on the impact of the behaviour. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A major conflict at work or home due to his rigidity. | - Disengage from the argument.<br>- The consequences of the conflict (e.g., a formal complaint, his wife withdrawing) are the natural consequences that need to be processed in therapy. |
| **De-escalation:** The conflict ends. | - He will likely retreat into the belief that he was right and the other person was wrong. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - The incident must be a key focus of his next therapy session.<br>- The therapist will focus on the long-term costs to him of this pattern of behaviour. |
