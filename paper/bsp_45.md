## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Apathy, work avoidance (e.g., coming in late, leaving early, not completing tasks), and passive-aggressive non-compliance. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The behaviours are present every workday. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe enough to place him at high risk of being fired. |
| **Setting events:** | The work environment itself.
| **Triggers:** | Being given a meaningless task, having to attend a pointless meeting, his boss asking him to work on a Saturday.
| **Risks:** | Job loss, financial instability, relationship breakdown due to his negative mood.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The sense of hopelessness that his situation will never change. The lack of any positive reinforcement in his daily life. His passive coping style. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

This is the first time Peter has sought help. The change in his behaviour has been gradual over the past year.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** A passive personality style.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Chronic, unresolved work-related stress and a lack of meaning in his role (burnout).
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The apathy and low energy from the depression make it impossible for him to take the steps needed to change his situation, creating a vicious cycle.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive girlfriend, his underlying skills and intelligence.

---

## Goals

*   To improve his mood and resolve his depressive episode.
*   To use behavioural activation to increase his engagement in pleasurable or meaningful activities.
*   To identify his core values and explore career options that are a better fit.
*   To improve his performance at his current job to avoid being fired in the short term.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Apathy and work avoidance | - Engage in evidence-based therapy for depression (e.g., CBT, Behavioural Activation).<br>- Schedule one small, non-work-related pleasant activity each day.<br>- Identify his core work and life values.<br>- Brainstorm alternative career paths or ways to make his current role more meaningful.<br>- Set small, achievable work-related goals each day to build a sense of mastery. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To identify and schedule activities based on his core values. |
| **Rationale:** | To combat the sense of meaninglessness that is driving his depression by reconnecting him with what is truly important to him, thereby increasing his motivation to change. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Peter to complete a values clarification exercise, identifying his core values in different life domains (e.g., relationships, career, personal growth). He will then be asked to brainstorm and schedule small, concrete actions he can take that are aligned with these values (e.g., if he values 'creativity', he could schedule 30 minutes to work on a personal coding project). |
| **Reinforcement:** | The intrinsic sense of meaning and purpose he gets from acting in line with his values. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending therapy, feeling apathetic but willing to try the exercises. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling an overwhelming sense of 'I can't be bothered', wanting to skip a scheduled activity. | - Acknowledge the feeling, but act opposite to it. This is a core principle of behavioural activation.<br>- Break the activity down into a smaller step (e.g., instead of going to the gym, just put on his gym clothes).<br>- Remind himself of his values and his long-term goals. |
| **Escalation:** Actively deciding not to go to work, staying in bed all day. | - This is a sign of a worsening depression.<br>- His girlfriend can offer support without criticism.<br>- He should contact his psychologist or GP. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Being fired from his job. | - While a negative outcome, this could also be a turning point.<br>- The focus in therapy would be on processing this event and using it as a catalyst for meaningful change, rather than seeing it as a confirmation of his failure. |
| **De-escalation:** N/A | N/A |
| **Recovery:** Starting to engage in valued activities and feeling a slight mood lift. | - This is a crucial time to reinforce the link between his actions and his feelings.<br>- The therapist will highlight his success and encourage him to build on it. |
