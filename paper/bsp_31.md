## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Isaac is an energetic and bright little boy who loves dinosaurs and building with blocks.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Isaac is intelligent, has good language skills, and can be very affectionate and loving when he is calm.
*   **Relevant social history:** Isaac is the only child of loving and concerned parents. The behavioural issues have been present since he was a toddler but have become more severe and frequent.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Isaac has a diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). This is characterized by severe recurrent temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion to the situation, and a persistently irritable or angry mood between outbursts.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Isaac can express himself well verbally, but when frustrated, he quickly resorts to screaming and shouting. He has great difficulty regulating his emotional response.
*   **Routine:** He struggles significantly with transitions and being denied what he wants.
*   **Sensory needs:** He can become overstimulated in noisy or busy environments, which can lower his frustration tolerance.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Isaac likes playing with his dinosaurs, building towers, and one-on-one time with his parents. He dislikes being told 'no', having to wait, and losing games.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Severe temper outbursts including screaming, shouting, throwing objects, and sometimes hitting or kicking parents. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Outbursts occur, on average, 3-4 times per week. They can last from 10 minutes to over an hour. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. The outbursts are highly disruptive and distressing for the family. There is a risk of injury to himself or others from thrown objects or aggression. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling tired, hungry, or overstimulated.
| **Triggers:** | Being told 'no' to a request, being asked to stop a preferred activity (e.g., turn off the TV), minor frustrations (e.g., a block tower falling over).
| **Risks:** | Injury to self or others, damage to property, exclusion from kindergarten or social activities, significant strain on parent-child relationship.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The neurological difficulty with emotion regulation, inadvertently giving in to his demands during an outburst. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Parents have tried various discipline strategies (e.g., time-outs, taking things away) which have often escalated the outbursts. They are now starting Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT).

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Neurobiological difficulties with emotion regulation.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A frustrating event or a limit being set.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** A coercive cycle where the intensity of the outburst sometimes leads to the parent giving in, which inadvertently reinforces the behaviour.
*   **Protective factors:** Loving and motivated parents, intelligence.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of temper outbursts.
*   To improve Isaac's ability to tolerate frustration and disappointment.
*   To teach parents skills to manage the outbursts effectively and to build a more positive relationship with Isaac.
*   To teach Isaac pro-social coping skills for managing anger.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Temper outbursts | - Parents to engage in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT).<br>- Focus on building a positive relationship through 'special play time' (child-directed play with no commands or criticism).<br>- Use praise and positive attention for calm and cooperative behaviour.<br>- Prepare Isaac for transitions with clear warnings.<br>- Ensure consistent routines and manage fatigue and hunger. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | For parents to learn and apply the skills from PCIT, particularly the skills for managing non-compliant and aggressive behaviour. For Isaac, to learn to identify his feelings. |
| **Rationale:** | PCIT is an evidence-based treatment that coaches parents in real-time to use specific skills. It first builds the parent-child relationship and then teaches calm, consistent discipline techniques, which is highly effective for DMDD. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The therapist will coach the parents through a one-way mirror while they play with Isaac. They will first learn to praise, reflect, and imitate (PRIDE skills). Then they will learn to give effective commands and to use a specific, non-escalating time-out procedure. The therapist will help the parents teach Isaac to label his feelings ('You seem really angry right now'). |
| **Reinforcement:** | Isaac receiving positive attention and praise for good behaviour. Parents feeling more confident and seeing a reduction in outbursts. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Persistently irritable mood, but not having an outburst. | Focus on proactive strategies, especially praise for any positive behaviour. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Whining, scowling, arguing back. | - Use active ignoring for minor whining.<br>- Validate the feeling ('I know you're disappointed, but it's time to turn off the TV').<br>- Give a clear, direct command for the expected behaviour. |
| **Escalation:** Starting to yell and shout. | - This is the point to use the specific PCIT discipline protocol.<br>- Give a clear warning about the consequence (e.g., time-out) if the behaviour continues. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Full outburst (screaming, throwing, hitting). | - Ensure everyone's safety. Remove dangerous objects.<br>- Calmly and consistently implement the time-out procedure as taught in PCIT. This involves a specific sequence of steps and is done with minimal talking. |
| **De-escalation:** The outburst ends, he is calming down. | - Once the time-out is over, he is required to complete the original instruction.<br>- Avoid lectures or discussions about the outburst. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Re-engage in positive activities.<br>- Look for the next opportunity to give positive attention for good behaviour. |
