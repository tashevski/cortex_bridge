## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Charlie is a quiet, sensitive, and highly intelligent high school student. He is an avid reader and a thoughtful writer.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Charlie is empathetic, observant, and a loyal friend once he gets to know someone. He aspires to have a close group of friends and to feel like he belongs.
*   **Relevant social history:** Charlie has a history of trauma and loss, including the death of a close relative. He has always been shy and introverted, but this has worsened in high school.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Charlie has a diagnosis of Avoidant Personality Disorder. This is a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. He avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection, and is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Charlie is articulate in writing but struggles to speak in social situations. He is very sensitive to perceived criticism. A warm, validating, and patient therapeutic approach is essential.
*   **Routine:** He avoids all non-essential social activities and spends most of his time alone in his room.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Charlie likes reading, writing, and listening to music. He dislikes parties, school dances, and any situation where he might be judged.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Complete avoidance of social situations, social inhibition, and preoccupation with being criticized or rejected. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The pattern is pervasive and has been present for several years. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. He has no friends and experiences intense anxiety at the thought of social interaction. |
| **Setting events:** | Any upcoming social event (e.g., a school assembly, a party).
| **Triggers:** | Being asked to speak in class, having to approach a group of people.
| **Risks:** | Severe social isolation, depression, suicidal ideation, failure to achieve his academic or vocational potential.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The avoidance of feared situations prevents him from learning that his fears are survivable and often unfounded. His negative self-beliefs act as a filter for his experiences. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Charlie has seen the school counsellor but has not previously engaged in structured, evidence-based therapy.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** An inhibited, anxious temperament. History of trauma.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The social pressures of high school.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The vicious cycle of avoidance and negative self-belief.
*   **Protective factors:** His intelligence, his supportive family, his desire for connection.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce his social anxiety and avoidance.
*   To challenge his negative core beliefs about himself ('I am uninteresting', 'I am inadequate').
*   To develop and practice social skills in a gradual and supportive way.
*   To build at least one or two close friendships.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Social avoidance and inhibition | - Engage in CBT or Schema Therapy to address the core beliefs of inadequacy.<br>- Develop a graded exposure hierarchy for social situations.<br>- Practice social skills (e.g., initiating conversations, giving compliments) in therapy.<br>- Join a structured, interest-based group to provide a context for social interaction. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use cognitive restructuring to challenge his negative automatic thoughts in social situations. |
| **Rationale:** | To help him recognize that his fears are driven by his thoughts, not by reality. By changing his thoughts, he can change his feelings and behaviours. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will teach Charlie to identify the negative thoughts that pop into his head in social situations (e.g., 'They think I'm weird'). He will learn to treat these thoughts as guesses, not facts, and to look for the evidence. He will then practice generating more realistic and compassionate alternative thoughts (e.g., 'They are probably not thinking about me at all. And even if they think I'm quiet, that's okay'). |
| **Reinforcement:** | The reduction in anxiety and the positive social experiences that become possible when he is not crippled by negative self-talk. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending therapy, willing to consider trying social experiments. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling intense anxiety before a planned social exposure task, having strong urges to cancel. | - Validate the anxiety ('I know this is really scary').<br>- Review his thought-challenging records and his goals.<br>- Break the task down into a smaller, more manageable step if necessary. |
| **Escalation:** Experiencing high anxiety or a panic attack in a social situation. | - Encourage him to stay in the situation if at all possible, and to use his coping skills (e.g., focusing on his breathing, focusing his attention externally).<br>- Remind him that the goal is to learn that he can survive the anxiety. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Fleeing a social situation. | - This is a lapse, not a failure.<br>- The key is to analyze what happened and to try again, perhaps with a slightly easier task.<br>- Avoid self-criticism. |
| **De-escalation:** The anxiety subsides. | - Praise him for his courage in attempting the task. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Process the experience in therapy. What did he learn? What would he do differently next time? How could he use his cognitive skills more effectively? |
