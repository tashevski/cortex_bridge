## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Max is a flamboyant and charismatic former theatre producer. He is grandiose, entitled, and has an unshakeable belief in his own superiority.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Max is highly intelligent, charming, and a masterful salesman. He is incredibly persuasive and can talk people into almost anything. He aspires to regain his former wealth and status.
*   - **Relevant social history:** Max has a long history of failed businesses, bankruptcies, and dubious financial schemes. He has always lived beyond his means and has a pattern of exploiting others for financial gain.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Max displays a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy, consistent with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). He also displays a disregard for and violation of the rights of others, consistent with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). This combination is often referred to as 'malignant narcissism'.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Max uses communication as a tool for manipulation. He is a convincing liar. It is critical to focus only on verifiable facts and observable behaviours.
*   **Routine:** He avoids routine and structure, preferring a chaotic lifestyle that provides more opportunities for exploitation.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Max likes luxury, admiration, and the thrill of the con. He dislikes rules, accountability, and being exposed as a failure.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Fraud, deception, exploitation of vulnerable people, and rageful outbursts when challenged or exposed. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The underlying pattern of entitlement and exploitation is constant. The fraudulent behaviour is opportunistic. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. His actions have led to financial ruin for his victims. |
| **Setting events:** | An opportunity to make 'easy money', access to vulnerable people (particularly the elderly).
| **Triggers:** | A perceived challenge to his status, a financial pressure.
| **Risks:** | Severe financial and emotional harm to others, immediate return to custody if he violates parole.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The financial rewards of his behaviour, his core belief that he is entitled to whatever he can take, and his lack of empathy for his victims. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Max has a long history of civil litigation related to his business dealings. This is his first criminal conviction. He sees therapy as a pointless exercise he must endure to satisfy his parole conditions.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Personality structure (NPD/ASPD).
*   **Precipitating factors:** An opportunity for exploitation.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The success of his schemes, the lack of accountability until now, and his inability to feel remorse.
*   **Protective factors:** (Very limited) The strict conditions of his parole.

---

## Goals

*   To ensure he does not re-offend during his parole period.
*   To ensure compliance with all parole conditions, including financial monitoring.
*   To protect the community from further financial predation.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fraud and exploitation | - Strict financial monitoring by his parole officer and a forensic accountant.<br>- He is not permitted to be involved in any business or have control over anyone else's finances.<br>- All employment must be approved by his parole officer.<br>- Focus all therapeutic work on the negative consequences of his actions *to him* (e.g., imprisonment). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To engage in consequential thinking. |
| **Rationale:** | As he lacks empathy, the only deterrent is a clear understanding that his actions will lead to negative consequences for himself. The goal is to make the link between the behaviour and the consequence (prison) immediate and clear. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will repeatedly and unemotionally link any discussion of past or potential future offending behaviour to the direct, personal, negative consequences. The focus is not on the morality of the act, but on its cost to him. Role-playing will focus on identifying high-risk situations and planning an exit strategy. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The avoidance of prison is the only meaningful reinforcer. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Superficially compliant with parole conditions. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. Maintain a high level of vigilance and skepticism. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Making grandiose claims about a new 'infallible' business idea, attempting to circumvent financial monitoring, associating with vulnerable people. | - Immediately investigate the claims.<br>- Report any suspicious activity to the parole officer.<br>- Reiterate the conditions of his parole and the consequences of breaching them. |
| **Escalation:** Being caught in a lie or a breach of his parole conditions. | - Expect a rageful, blaming, and manipulative response.<br>- Do not argue or engage with the emotional content.<br>- Stick to the verifiable facts. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A clear breach of parole has been detected (e.g., a new attempt at fraud). | - This must be managed through official legal and correctional channels.<br>- The parole officer must be informed immediately. |
| **De-escalation:** The breach has been actioned. | - He will likely present as the victim. Do not engage with this narrative. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline (e.g., following a parole hearing). | - The focus remains on the enforcement of the consequences. The therapeutic relationship, such as it is, will focus on the choices *he* made that led to the negative consequence *for him*. |
