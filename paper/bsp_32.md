| **Risks:** | Financial ruin, loss of his home, marriage breakdown, depression, suicidal ideation due to financial stress.

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Kevin has hidden the extent of his gambling for years. This is the first time he has sought professional help, prompted by the ultimatum from his wife.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** History of recreational gambling, impulsivity.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Retirement, leading to loss of routine and purpose.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The reinforcing nature of intermittent wins, cognitive distortions about gambling, chasing losses.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive wife (if he remains abstinent), motivation to change, good physical health.

---

## Goals

*   To achieve complete abstinence from all forms of gambling.
*   To hand over control of his finances to his wife and a financial counsellor.
*   To develop a new, positive, and structured routine for his retirement.
*   To find alternative ways to manage boredom and stress.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Gambling | - Attend regular counselling and Gamblers Anonymous meetings.<br>- Implement a self-exclusion order from all local gambling venues.<br>- Install gambling-blocking software on his computer and phone.<br>- Hand over all financial control (bank cards, accounts) to his wife.<br>- Plan and schedule alternative, enjoyable, and meaningful activities for each day. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To identify and challenge gambling-related cognitive distortions. |
| **Rationale:** | To undermine the irrational beliefs that fuel gambling, such as the illusion of control, the gambler's fallacy (e.g., 'I'm due for a win'), and chasing losses. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will help Kevin to identify his specific irrational thoughts about gambling. They will then use a thought record to examine the evidence for and against these thoughts, and to generate more realistic and helpful alternatives (e.g., 'The machine is random, and chasing losses will only lead to bigger losses'). |
| **Reinforcement:** | The feeling of control from not acting on an urge and the reduction in financial stress are the primary reinforcers. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Abstinent from gambling, following the plan. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling bored or restless, thinking about past wins, having an urge to go to the RSL. | - Immediately call his sponsor from Gamblers Anonymous or his wife.<br>- Use urge surfing techniques to manage the craving.<br>- Engage in a planned alternative activity (e.g., go to his workshop, go fishing).<br>- Remind himself of the negative consequences of gambling. |
| **Escalation:** Driving towards a gambling venue or trying to access an online account. | - This is a critical point. He needs to make a different choice.<br>- Pull the car over and call for support. Step away from the computer. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A lapse has occurred (he has gambled). | - He must be honest and tell his wife and therapist immediately.<br>- This is a lapse, not a full relapse, and it is crucial to get back on track immediately to prevent a spiral. |
| **De-escalation:** The gambling episode is over. | - Focus on honesty and accountability.<br>- Re-engage with the support system. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to abstinence. | - Analyze the chain of events that led to the lapse.<br>- Identify what went wrong with the plan and how to strengthen it for the future. |
