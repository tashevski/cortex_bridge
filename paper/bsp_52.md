## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | School refusal, crying and clinging to parents at drop-off, and repeatedly seeking reassurance that his parents are safe. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Occurs every school day. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. He is missing a significant amount of school. The distress at drop-off is extreme for both him and his parents. |
| **Setting events:** | Sunday nights, school mornings.
| **Triggers:** | The school drop-off, his parents leaving for work.
| **Risks:** | Significant academic and social impairment due to school refusal, development of other anxiety disorders or depression.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The avoidance of school reduces his anxiety in the short term. The reassurance he receives from his parents also temporarily reduces his anxiety, reinforcing the reassurance-seeking behaviour. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Parents have tried many strategies, including long goodbyes and letting him stay home, which have inadvertently made the problem worse. They are now starting CBT.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Anxious temperament.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The transition to primary school.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The cycle of avoidance and reassurance-seeking.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive parents, good relationship with his teacher.

---

## Goals

*   To ensure Christopher attends school every day.
*   To reduce the distress shown at school drop-offs.
*   To build his confidence in his ability to cope with separation.
*   To reduce his need for reassurance.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| School refusal and clinging | - Parents and school to work together to create a consistent plan.<br>- Establish a clear and predictable morning routine.<br>- The drop-off must be brief and calm. A parent says a firm but loving goodbye and then leaves, without lingering.<br>- The teacher should have an engaging activity ready to distract him immediately.<br>- Create a 'bravery ladder' of steps towards independence (e.g., parent standing at the classroom door, then in the hallway, then at the school gate). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use 'detective thinking' to challenge his anxious thoughts. |
| **Rationale:** | To help him to test the reality of his fears (e.g., 'What is the evidence that something bad will happen to mum today?') and to recognize them as just worries, not facts. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Christopher to externalize his anxiety (e.g., call it the 'Worry Monster'). They will practice being a 'detective' and looking for the clues or evidence that the Worry Monster is telling lies. For example, 'The Worry Monster says something bad will happen. Let's check the evidence. What happened yesterday when you went to school? Did something bad happen to mum? No. The Worry Monster was wrong!' |
| **Reinforcement:** | Praise for being a brave detective. A reward system (e.g., a sticker chart) for successful school drop-offs. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** At home with parents, feeling calm. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** On a school morning, complaining of a tummy ache, asking lots of questions about where his parents will be. | - Acknowledge the feeling but not the content ('I know you have those worry feelings in your tummy').<br>- Stick to the routine. Do not get drawn into a long discussion or provide excessive reassurance.<br>- Remind him of his bravery plan. |
| **Escalation:** Crying and clinging at the school gate, refusing to let go of his parent. | - This is the most critical point. The parent must follow the plan.<br>- Give one final, calm and loving goodbye ('I love you, I will see you this afternoon') and physically hand him over to the care of the waiting teacher.<br>- The parent must then leave immediately, even if he is crying. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Intense distress, crying, calling for his parents after they have left. | - The teacher's role is to comfort and distract him.<br>- The teacher should express confidence in his ability to cope ('I know it's hard, but you are safe here and we are going to have a fun day'). |
| **De-escalation:** He begins to calm down and engage in the classroom activity. | - The teacher should give him praise and positive attention for calming down and participating. |
| **Recovery:** At school pick-up. | - The parent should greet him warmly and praise him for being brave and going to school. Do not focus on the morning's distress. |
