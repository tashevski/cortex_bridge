| :--- | :--- |

## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Michael is a long-serving and successful regional manager of a paper company. He sees himself as a beloved entertainer, mentor, and friend to his employees.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Michael is a talented salesman and can be very charming and persuasive. He genuinely desires to be liked and admired by others.
*   **Relevant social history:** Michael reports a lonely childhood and has a deep-seated need to be the center of attention and to create a 'family' environment at work.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Michael has a diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). He has a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy. He is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success and power, believes he is 'special', and has a sense of entitlement.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** He dominates conversations and often fails to listen to others. He is highly sensitive to criticism (narcissistic injury). Therapy must be framed in a way that appeals to his self-interest (e.g., 'This will help you become an even more successful manager').
*   **Routine:** His work routine is often chaotic and filled with unproductive meetings and attempts at 'team building' that are more about him than the team.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Michael likes being the center of attention, praise, and public recognition. He dislikes being criticized, ignored, or seeing others succeed more than him.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Exploitative interpersonal behaviour (e.g., taking credit for others' work), rageful outbursts in response to criticism, and a reckless disregard for professional boundaries. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The underlying entitlement and lack of empathy are constant. Rageful outbursts occur whenever he feels criticized or his self-image is threatened. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate to Severe. The behaviour creates a toxic work environment and puts the company at risk of legal action. His rages can be intensely intimidating. |
| **Setting events:** | A subordinate receiving praise, a corporate review of his performance.
| **Triggers:** | Any form of perceived criticism, however mild. Being excluded from a decision or a social event.
| **Risks:** | Job loss, creating a hostile work environment, bullying and harassment claims, complete alienation of his staff.
| **Maintaining factors:** | His senior position allows him to get away with the behaviour. His staff often placate him to avoid his rage. His core belief in his own superiority. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

This behaviour has characterized his entire management career. This is the first time he has been mandated to attend any form of therapy or coaching.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Likely a combination of early life experiences and temperament, leading to the development of a fragile self-esteem that is masked by grandiosity.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A narcissistic injury (a threat to his sense of superiority).
*   **Perpetuating factors:** His position of power, the enabling behaviour of those around him, his inability to self-reflect.
*   **Protective factors:** His genuine sales talent, which has made him valuable to the company.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce the number of official complaints from staff.
*   To eliminate rageful outbursts in the workplace.
*   To increase behaviours that show respect for professional boundaries.
*   To improve his ability to tolerate criticism without reacting aggressively.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rage and boundary violations | - Engage in structured, goal-oriented therapy/coaching.<br>- Frame all feedback in terms of how it will help him achieve greater success.<br>- Use role-playing to practice appropriate workplace communication.<br>- Establish very clear rules of engagement for meetings, with an independent facilitator if necessary. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To learn to pause and use a scripted response when feeling criticized. |
| **Rationale:** | To interrupt the automatic, rageful reaction to a narcissistic injury, providing a moment for him to choose a more adaptive response that will have better consequences for him. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will work with Michael to identify the physical and mental signs that he is feeling 'injured'. They will then devise and rehearse a simple, neutral, scripted response he can use, such as, 'Thank you for that feedback. I need to take some time to consider it.' The goal is not to agree with the criticism, but to delay the reaction. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The avoidance of negative consequences (e.g., another HR complaint). Being seen as a more 'in control' and powerful leader. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Functioning in his role, no current complaints. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Becoming defensive, changing the subject back to his own achievements, subtly putting others down. | - Do not engage in a power struggle.<br>- If you are his superior, provide feedback using the agreed-upon model (focusing on behaviour and consequences for him).<br>- If you are his subordinate, disengage from the conversation. |
| **Escalation:** Becoming angry, voice getting louder, making personal attacks. | - Stay calm and do not become defensive. This will only fuel the rage.<br>- End the conversation immediately. ('I can see you are upset. We can talk about this later when we are both calmer').<br>- Leave the room if necessary to ensure your own psychological safety. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A full narcissistic rage (yelling, threats, intimidation). | - Your safety is the priority. Do not stay in the room.<br>- The incident must be documented and reported to HR as per company policy. |
| **De-escalation:** The rage subsides. He may act as if nothing happened or try to charm his way back into good graces. | - Do not engage as if nothing happened. The issue must be addressed through formal channels.<br>- Maintain professional boundaries. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - The consequences for the behaviour must be implemented by HR as per the management plan.<br>- The incident will be a focus of his next mandatory coaching session. |
