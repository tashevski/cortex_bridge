## Purpose

The purpose of this Comprehensive Behaviour Support Plan is to:

*   Ensure the safety of all staff, other patients, and the community.
*   Manage the extreme risk of violence and homicide posed by Patrick.
*   Provide a clear and consistent management plan for all staff within the high-security hospital.
*   Note: The goals are entirely focused on risk management and containment, as rehabilitation is considered highly unlikely.

## Consultation

### Consultation with the Person

| What was the person consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- |
| Patrick was consulted as part of his assessment following his arrest for multiple homicides. He discussed the events in a detached, grandiose, and unemotional manner, focusing on the aesthetic details of his crimes. | N/A |

### Consultation with Others

| Name, role and contact details | What were they consulted about, when and how | Details provided about intent to include RRP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Homicide Detectives** | The details of the crime scenes, the nature of the violence, and the evidence collected. | N/A |
| **Collateral information from acquaintances** | Patrick's superficial charm, his obsession with status and appearances, and his underlying emptiness and rage. | N/A |

## Other Sources of Information

*   **Police Crime Scene Reports and Evidence Files**
*   **Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R)** - Scored at the maximum level.

## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Patrick is a wealthy and successful investment banker. His entire life is dedicated to maintaining a facade of perfection, conformity, and high status.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Patrick is intelligent, meticulous, and highly skilled at feigning normality and charm. His aspirations revolve around status, materialism, and satisfying his violent sadistic urges.
*   **Relevant social history:** Patrick comes from a wealthy and powerful family. He has no genuine relationships; all his interactions are superficial and goal-oriented.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Patrick embodies a prototypical combination of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) and Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), with extreme levels of psychopathy. He has a complete lack of empathy, a grandiose sense of self-worth, and a sadistic drive to inflict suffering on others.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** He is a highly articulate and skilled conversationalist, but this is part of his mask of sanity. All interactions must be viewed through the lens of risk assessment.
*   **Routine:** He is obsessed with his daily routine of exercise, grooming, and maintaining his appearance.
*   **Sensory needs:** He is highly attuned to sensory details, particularly as they relate to status and aesthetics.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** He likes status symbols, high fashion, popular music, and inflicting torture and murder. He dislikes anything that threatens his sense of superiority or exposes his inner emptiness.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Sadistic violence, torture, homicide, and cannibalism. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The underlying violent urges are constant. The acting out of these urges is opportunistic. |
| **Intensity:** | Extreme. The violence is premeditated, calculated, and exceptionally brutal. |
| **Setting events:** | A perceived narcissistic injury (e.g., someone having a better business card than him), feelings of boredom or emptiness.
| **Triggers:** | An opportunity to lure a victim to a secure location.
| **Risks:** | Torture and death of others.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The intense feelings of power, control, and gratification he gets from inflicting suffering. His ability to blend in and avoid detection. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Patrick has a long-standing, secret history of escalating violent behaviour. He has had no prior treatment.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** A profound lack of empathy and an innately sadistic nature, likely due to a combination of neurobiological and unknown environmental factors.
*   **Precipitating factors:** An opportunity and a trigger (narcissistic injury).
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The powerful reinforcement he gets from the acts themselves. His ability to avoid capture.
*   **Protective factors:** None.

---

## Goals

*   To prevent any and all harm to staff and other patients.
*   To ensure he remains securely contained for the remainder of his natural life.
*   To monitor his behaviour for any signs of escalating risk.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Violence | - Permanent containment in a high-security forensic hospital.<br>- All interactions with him must be conducted by a minimum of two experienced forensic staff.<br>- Maintain unpredictable routines for cell searches and checks to prevent him from identifying patterns he can exploit.<br>- All therapeutic engagement is for the purpose of risk assessment only, not treatment. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | N/A |
| **Rationale:** | Skill development is not a relevant goal. There is no evidence that psychopathy of this severity can be treated or that he can learn skills like empathy or remorse. Any attempt to teach him skills would likely result in him learning to mimic them to become a more effective predator. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | N/A |
| **Reinforcement:** | N/A |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Superficially charming and compliant. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. Maintain maximum security and vigilance. Assume this is part of his mask. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Subtle attempts to test boundaries, gathering information about staff, attempting to split staff against each other. | - Immediately document and share this information with the entire clinical team.<br>- Staff must present a completely united and consistent front.<br>- Reiterate boundaries in a firm, unemotional manner. |
| **Escalation:** Making veiled threats, showing increased interest in a potential victim. | - Increase security protocols immediately.<br>- Restrict his access to potential victims.<br>- A formal review of his risk management plan is required. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** An overt act of violence. | - Implement the facility's highest-level emergency and containment protocol. The immediate priority is the safety of the victim and staff. |
| **De-escalation:** The incident is contained. | - He will be managed through segregation and other high-level security procedures. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - A full-scale review of the incident and the management plan is required to identify and rectify any security failures. |

## Regulated Restrictive Practices

Patrick will be managed under the most stringent and restrictive practices available within the forensic mental health and correctional systems, including long-term segregation, mechanical restraints when being transferred, and chemical restraint if required to manage acute, uncontrollable violence. All such practices will be in accordance with the law and hospital policy.
