## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Sam is a quiet and artistic young man who is currently studying graphic design. He is highly creative and detail-oriented.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Sam is talented in art and design, intelligent, and sensitive. He hopes to work as a designer but currently feels his appearance is holding him back.
*   **Relevant social history:** Sam was bullied about his acne during his teenage years. He now has a small group of friends but avoids many social situations.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Sam has a diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). He is preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in his physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. His main preoccupation is with his skin.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Sam finds it difficult to talk about his BDD due to shame. He often speaks in general terms about 'not looking right'. He benefits from a non-judgmental and compassionate approach.
*   **Routine:** Sam has a very rigid and time-consuming grooming routine every morning and evening.
*   **Sensory needs:** He is highly focused on visual stimuli, particularly his own reflection.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Sam likes drawing, digital art, and watching movies. He dislikes mirrors, bright lighting, and having his photo taken.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Compulsive mirror checking, skin picking, excessive grooming, and social avoidance. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The rituals (mirror checking, grooming) occur for several hours each day. Social avoidance is constant. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. Skin picking has led to minor scarring. He has missed university lectures and social events for weeks at a time. |
| **Setting events:** | Upcoming social events, seeing photos of himself, feeling stressed.
| **Triggers:** | Catching his reflection in a mirror or window, perceived comments about his appearance.
| **Risks:** | Suicidal ideation, severe depression, social and occupational impairment, skin damage/infection.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The temporary reduction in anxiety from checking or grooming, the belief that he can 'fix' the flaw, avoidance of feared situations. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

The preoccupation began at age 16 and has worsened since starting university. He has recently started Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with a focus on Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** History of being bullied, perfectionistic traits, aesthetic sensitivity.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The increased social pressures of university.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Compulsive behaviours and rituals, social avoidance, cognitive biases (e.g., over-focus on details).
*   **Protective factors:** Artistic talent, supportive family, insight that the beliefs may be exaggerated.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce the time spent on BDD-related rituals and preoccupations.
*   To decrease social avoidance and increase participation in university and social life.
*   To challenge the underlying beliefs about appearance and self-worth.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rituals and avoidance | - Engage in CBT with Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).<br>- Create a hierarchy for mirror exposure and ritual prevention.<br>- Practice strategies to challenge cognitive distortions related to appearance.<br>- Gradually reduce time spent on grooming rituals. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) for mirror checking and grooming. |
| **Rationale:** | To help Sam learn to tolerate the anxiety associated with his appearance concerns without resorting to compulsive rituals, thereby breaking the cycle that maintains BDD. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | With his therapist, Sam will create a plan to gradually change his ritualistic behaviours. This might start with covering some mirrors, then reducing the time he is allowed to look in a mirror, and resisting the urge to pick his skin. He will learn to 'sit with' the anxiety until it naturally reduces. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Praise from the therapist for his courage. Tracking his own success in reducing ritual time and engaging in avoided activities will be a key reinforcer. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending therapy, attempting ERP exercises. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Increased urge to check mirrors, spending more time thinking about his skin. | - Encourage him to use his CBT skills (e.g., thought challenging).<br>- Remind him of his ERP goals.<br>- Suggest a distracting, enjoyable activity. |
| **Escalation:** Feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, spending hours in the bathroom performing rituals. | - Do not get into a debate about his appearance.<br>- Gently remind him of the ERP plan ('Let's try to stick to the 10-minute plan we made').<br>- Validate the feeling, not the content ('I know this is incredibly hard and makes you anxious'). |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Intense distress, expressing hopelessness or suicidal thoughts. | - Take all expressions of hopelessness seriously.<br>- Implement the crisis plan, which includes contacting his therapist or a crisis line. |
| **De-escalation:** Calming down, stopping the ritual. | - Praise the effort to stop.<br>- Avoid criticism or expressing frustration. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Problem-solve what triggered the escalation.<br>- Review the ERP plan and adjust if a step was too large. |
