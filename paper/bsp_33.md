## Purpose

The purpose of this Comprehensive Behaviour Support Plan is to:

*   Manage the risk Frank poses to others within the correctional facility and upon potential release.
*   Address offending behaviour through court-mandated programs.
*   Provide a consistent management plan for correctional staff.
*   Note: The plan is developed within a risk management framework, as genuine empathy and remorse are unlikely to be achieved.

*   **All about me:** Frank is a highly intelligent and charismatic man with a history of high-flying careers in business and politics, which have invariably ended in disgrace and criminal charges.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Manipulation of staff and other inmates, standover tactics, physical assault, fraud, and deceit. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The manipulative and deceitful behaviours are constant. Aggression occurs when his goals are blocked or he feels disrespected. |

| **Setting events:** | Being placed in a position of perceived low status, having his plans thwarted.
| **Triggers:** | A perceived slight or challenge to his authority, an opportunity for personal gain.
| **Risks:** | Serious physical harm to others, inciting conflict between other inmates, corrupting staff, re-offending upon release.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The success of his manipulative tactics in achieving his goals, a core lack of empathy, a belief that he is superior to others. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Frank has a lifelong history of antisocial behaviour. Previous attempts at therapy have been unsuccessful, as he has used the therapeutic environment to further hone his manipulation skills.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Likely a combination of genetic/neurobiological factors and a history of conduct disorder.
*   **Precipitating factors:** An opportunity to exploit a situation or person for personal gain.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** A core lack of empathy and conscience, the reinforcement he gets from successful manipulation.
*   **Protective factors:** (Limited) The highly structured environment of the correctional facility which limits his opportunities.

---

## Goals

*   To ensure the safety of staff and other inmates.
*   To ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of the facility.
*   To reduce the frequency of aggressive and manipulative behaviours.
*   To complete court-mandated offending behaviour programs.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Manipulation and aggression | - Maintain strong professional boundaries at all times. Do not share personal information.<br>- Staff communication must be consistent. All staff should be aware of the management plan.<br>- Focus on observable behaviours and clear, enforceable consequences.<br>- Avoid getting drawn into arguments or power struggles. State the rule and the consequence, then disengage.<br>- Enrolment in programs that focus on consequential thinking, not empathy-building. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use a cost-benefit analysis to guide behaviour. |
| **Rationale:** | Since he lacks empathy, appeals to the impact of his behaviour on others are ineffective. The only effective strategy is to appeal to his own self-interest by focusing on the negative consequences to himself of his actions. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | In a structured therapeutic setting, the psychologist will work with Frank to analyze his offending behaviour purely in terms of its costs (e.g., prison sentence, loss of status) and benefits to him. The goal is to demonstrate that, in the long term, the costs of his antisocial actions outweigh the short-term benefits. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The avoidance of negative consequences (e.g., loss of privileges, further charges) is the only meaningful reinforcement. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Superficially compliant, observing routines. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. Maintain vigilance for subtle manipulations. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Attempting to be overly familiar with staff, trying to find out personal information, testing boundaries. | - Immediately and firmly re-establish professional boundaries ('That is not appropriate to discuss').<br>- Document the incident and share with other staff. |
| **Escalation:** Becoming irritable, making veiled threats, attempting to intimidate others. | - Use a calm, assertive, and non-emotional tone.<br>- Clearly state the rule he is breaking and the consequence if he continues.<br>- Ensure other staff are present if possible. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Physical assault or overt standover tactics. | - Immediately implement facility safety and emergency procedures.<br>- The priority is to ensure the safety of all individuals. |
| **De-escalation:** The incident is over. | - The incident must be managed through official correctional facility procedures, including formal charges and loss of privileges. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - There should be no informal processing of the event with Frank.<br>- The focus remains on the consequences of his behaviour. |
