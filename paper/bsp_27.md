## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Excessive and compulsive video gaming, primarily online multiplayer games. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Plays for 8-12 hours a day, every day. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. Gaming has led to him deferring university, losing his part-time job, and neglecting his health and hygiene. |
| **Setting events:** | Unstructured time, being alone in his room.
| **Triggers:** | Notifications from the game, messages from online friends, boredom, stress.
| **Risks:** | Failure to engage in education or employment, social isolation (from offline world), sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, depression.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The variable reward schedule of the game, the social status he has online, avoidance of real-world stressors and responsibilities. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

His parents have tried setting limits and turning off the internet, which has led to intense conflict and anger. This is the first time they are seeking professional help.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Possible predisposition to addictive behaviours, introverted personality.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The unstructured time after finishing high school, the social anxieties of starting university.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The immersive and reinforcing nature of the game, the social network within the game, avoidance of real-life challenges.
*   **Protective factors:** High intelligence, supportive family, previous academic success.

---

## Goals

*   To significantly reduce gaming time to a controlled, non-harmful level.
*   To re-establish a healthy daily routine (sleep, diet, exercise).
*   To re-engage with offline social activities and responsibilities (e.g., education, employment).
*   To develop coping strategies for boredom and stress.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Excessive gaming | - Engage in CBT for behavioural addictions.<br>- Create a 'gaming schedule' with clear, negotiated time limits.<br>- Make the bedroom a 'game-free' zone (move the computer to a family area if possible).<br>- Plan and schedule alternative, enjoyable offline activities.<br>- Uninstall the most problematic games. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use activity scheduling and behavioural activation. |
| **Rationale:** | To combat the boredom and lack of structure that triggers gaming by proactively planning a balanced week of alternative activities that provide a sense of achievement or pleasure. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | Ryan will work with his psychologist to create a weekly schedule. He will identify and schedule a variety of activities, including social (e.g., meet a friend), educational (e.g., 1 hour of uni prep), physical (e.g., go for a walk), and creative (e.g., learn a new software). The key is to start with small, achievable goals. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The natural reinforcement from re-engaging with life (e.g., feeling healthier, reduced conflict with parents). A reward system negotiated with parents for sticking to the schedule can also be used. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Sticking to his gaming schedule. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Thinking about the game constantly, watching gaming streams online, negotiating to extend his time. | - Recognize this as a high-risk period.<br>- Use 'urge surfing' mindfulness techniques to ride out the craving.<br>- Immediately engage in a planned alternative activity.<br>- Talk to his parents or psychologist about the urge. |
| **Escalation:** Breaking the schedule and continuing to game past his limit. | - Parents to provide a calm, firm reminder of the agreed-upon schedule and consequences (e.g., internet is turned off at the agreed time).<br>- Avoid getting into a lengthy argument or negotiation. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Becoming angry and irritable when the limit is enforced. | - Parents to remain calm and disengage from the conflict.<br>- State the boundary clearly and walk away. |
| **De-escalation:** Calming down after the conflict. | - Once calm, parents can briefly and neutrally restate the importance of sticking to the plan for his own goals. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - The next day, problem-solve what led to the lapse.<br>- Re-commit to the schedule. Do not use the lapse as an excuse for punishment or shame. |
