## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Sophie is a bright and articulate primary school teacher. She is passionate about her work and is highly regarded by her colleagues and students' parents.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Sophie is motivated, insightful, and determined to overcome her hair-pulling. She hopes to feel more confident and to stop having to hide the hair loss.
*   **Relevant social history:** The hair-pulling started in her early teens during a stressful period of exams. It has waxed and waned in severity over the years. She feels a great deal of shame about the behaviour.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Sophie has a diagnosis of Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder). This involves recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, and repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Sophie finds it very difficult to talk about the pulling. She benefits from a matter-of-fact, non-judgmental, and collaborative therapeutic approach.
*   **Routine:** The pulling often occurs in specific situations when she is engaged in sedentary activities (e.g., watching TV, reading, marking schoolwork).
*   **Sensory needs:** She often experiences a sense of tension or an urge before pulling, and a feeling of gratification or relief after the hair is pulled.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Sophie likes hiking, reading, and spending time with friends. She dislikes feeling stressed, bored, and being in situations where her hair loss might be visible (e.g., swimming).

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Pulling out scalp hair, one strand at a time. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Can occur in long sessions lasting up to an hour, usually several times a week. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. Has resulted in noticeable bald patches that she covers with careful hairstyling. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling stressed, tired, or bored. Being alone.
| **Triggers:** | Sedentary activities where her hands are not occupied (e.g., watching TV, reading). Feeling for a hair that feels 'different'.
| **Risks:** | Permanent hair loss, skin irritation, significant distress and shame, social avoidance.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The cycle of tension and relief, the behaviour becoming an automatic habit, the shame preventing her from seeking help. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Sophie has tried to stop on her own many times without success. This is her first time seeking evidence-based treatment for Trichotillomania.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Possible genetic predisposition, stressful onset period.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Stress, boredom, sedentary activities.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The behaviour becoming a deeply ingrained habit, the reinforcing nature of the tension-release cycle.
*   **Protective factors:** High motivation for change, strong social support system, good insight.

---

## Goals

*   To eliminate hair-pulling behaviour.
*   To develop self-awareness of triggers and warning signs.
*   To learn and implement effective coping strategies and competing responses.
*   To reduce feelings of shame and to improve self-esteem.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hair pulling | - Engage in Habit Reversal Training (HRT), a core component of CBT for this condition.<br>- Use 'stimulus control' strategies: identify and modify high-risk situations (e.g., wear a beanie or gloves while watching TV, sit on hands).<br>- Keep a detailed log of pulling episodes to increase awareness.<br>- Practice stress management and relaxation techniques. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use Habit Reversal Training (HRT), specifically awareness training and competing response training. |
| **Rationale:** | To make the automatic behaviour more conscious and to provide a specific, physically incompatible action to perform instead of pulling, thereby breaking the habit. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The therapist will first help Sophie become highly aware of every aspect of the pulling behaviour chain. Then, they will work together to devise a 'competing response' - an action she can do with her hands that is inconspicuous and prevents pulling (e.g., clenching her fists, making a fist and placing it on her lap) for 1-2 minutes until the urge passes. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The primary reinforcement is the successful prevention of a pulling episode and the resulting sense of control and reduction in hair loss. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Not pulling, using HRT skills. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling the urge to pull, hand drifting towards her head. | - Immediately implement the competing response.<br>- Get up and change the activity or environment (e.g., get a drink, walk around).<br>- Use a fidget toy to keep hands busy. |
| **Escalation:** Having pulled one or two hairs. | - This is a 'lapse', not a 'relapse'. Avoid catastrophic thinking ('I've failed').<br>- Immediately engage in the competing response to prevent a full episode.<br>- Record the lapse in her log and analyze the trigger. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** A full pulling episode has occurred. | - Do not engage in self-criticism or shame.<br>- Treat it as a learning opportunity.<br>- Analyze the chain of events that led to the episode in detail with the therapist. |
| **De-escalation:** The episode is over. | - Engage in a self-soothing activity (e.g., have a warm shower, listen to calming music). |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Re-commit to the HRT plan.<br>- Problem-solve with the therapist how to manage that specific trigger in the future. |
