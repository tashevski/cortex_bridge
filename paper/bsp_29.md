## About the Person

*   **All about me:** George is a quiet and introverted man who works as a data entry clerk. He lives with his mother.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** George is diligent and reliable in his work. He is close to his mother. He hopes to one day feel safe enough to move out of home.
*   **Relevant social history:** George was a shy child and had few friends. The delusional beliefs began to emerge in his late 20s.
*   **Disability and health needs:** George has a diagnosis of Delusional Disorder, persecutory type. He holds a fixed, false belief that he is being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, or obstructed. Apart from the delusion, his functioning is not markedly impaired and his behaviour is not obviously bizarre.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** George is reluctant to talk about his beliefs for fear the information will get back to his 'persecutors'. It is crucial not to directly challenge the delusion. A supportive, non-confrontational approach is needed.
*   **Routine:** He has a very rigid routine, travelling the same way to work each day and rarely going out for other reasons.
*   **Sensory needs:** He is hypervigilant to sounds and other people's behaviour, interpreting them as evidence for his delusion.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** George likes reading and watching movies. He dislikes being in crowded places or feeling like he is being watched.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Social withdrawal, hypervigilance, safety-seeking behaviours (e.g., covering windows, repeatedly checking locks), and potential for confronting his perceived persecutors. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The delusional beliefs are constant. The associated behaviours occur daily. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate to Severe. His social life is non-existent. There is a risk of him acting on his beliefs, which could lead to legal or interpersonal conflict. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling stressed or isolated.
| **Triggers:** | Seeing a stranger who looks suspicious to him, hearing an unexpected noise outside, seeing a van parked on his street.
| **Risks:** | Severe social isolation, depression, potential for aggressive acts if he feels he needs to 'defend' himself, job loss if his behaviour escalates at work.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The fixed and encapsulated nature of the delusion, cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias - only noticing things that support his belief). |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

George's mother brought him for assessment after he accused a neighbour of being a government agent. He has not had any previous psychiatric treatment. He has agreed to take antipsychotic medication.

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Possible genetic/neurobiological factors, introverted and suspicious personality traits.
*   **Precipitating factors:** A period of work-related stress may have preceded the onset.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The delusion itself provides an explanation for his feelings of anxiety and isolation. The safety-seeking behaviours prevent any disconfirming evidence.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive mother, stable employment, willingness to engage with a trusted psychiatrist.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce the distress and anxiety associated with the delusional beliefs.
*   To reduce the socially isolating safety-seeking behaviours.
*   To improve his quality of life and social functioning.
*   To maintain adherence to medication.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Preoccupation and safety-seeking | - Maintain a strong therapeutic alliance with the psychiatrist.<br>- Ensure medication adherence.<br>- Use CBT for psychosis techniques: do not challenge the delusion directly, but explore the evidence in a collaborative way ('Let's be detectives together').<br>- Focus on the distress the beliefs cause, rather than their content.<br>- Gently encourage him to test out his beliefs in small ways (e.g., 'What do you think would happen if we looked behind the curtain?'). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To develop alternative, non-delusional explanations for events. |
| **Rationale:** | To increase cognitive flexibility and to gently introduce doubt about the delusion without causing him to disengage from treatment. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychiatrist will use a Socratic questioning approach. When George reports an event that confirms his delusion (e.g., 'A man in a white car drove past twice'), the psychiatrist will ask for other possible explanations ('I wonder what other reasons a person might drive down a street twice? Could they be lost? Visiting a neighbour?'). The goal is to generate possibilities, not to force him to accept one. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Praise for his willingness to think flexibly. A reduction in his own anxiety when he considers a less threatening explanation is the main reinforcer. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Taking medication, attending appointments, functioning at work. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Increased preoccupation with the delusion, spending more time checking locks or windows. | - Express empathy for his increased distress ('It sounds like you're feeling very unsafe at the moment').<br>- Encourage him to use distraction or anxiety management techniques.<br>- Gently prompt him to consider alternative explanations. |
| **Escalation:** Becoming agitated and angry, wanting to confront a perceived persecutor. | - The priority is to de-escalate and ensure safety.<br>- Do not argue about the delusion. Shift the focus to the consequences of his planned action ('What do you think would happen if you confronted him? What would the police do?').<br>- Contact the psychiatrist or crisis team for advice. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Making a direct threat or attempting to act on the delusion. | - This is a psychiatric emergency. Contact the police or crisis team immediately.<br>- Ensure your own safety. |
| **De-escalation:** Calming down, abandoning the plan to confront someone. | - Provide reassurance and support.<br>- Praise him for making a safe choice. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Review the incident with the psychiatrist.<br>- This may indicate a need for a medication review or more intensive support. |
