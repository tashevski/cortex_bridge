## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Sophia is a passionate and creative fine arts student. She is known for her intense energy and her periods of quiet introspection.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Sophia is highly creative, energetic, and charismatic. She is very productive creatively during her 'up' periods. She hopes to become a successful artist.
*   **Relevant social history:** Sophia has always been seen as 'moody' or 'temperamental'. She has a history of intense but unstable friendships and romantic relationships.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Sophia has a diagnosis of Cyclothymic Disorder. For at least two years, she has had numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** When hypomanic, her speech can be fast and tangential. When depressed, she can be withdrawn and quiet. A consistent and grounding therapeutic presence is helpful.
*   **Routine:** Her routine is highly variable and depends on her mood state. She has poor sleep hygiene.
*   **Sensory needs:** No specific sensory sensitivities noted.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Sophia likes starting new art projects, socializing, and late nights. She dislikes routine, boredom, and the periods of low energy and motivation.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | During hypomanic periods: impulsivity, poor judgment, increased risk-taking (e.g., reckless spending, unsafe sex). During depressive periods: social withdrawal, anhedonia, and low-level suicidal ideation. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The mood fluctuations are frequent and have been present for several years. An 'up' period might last for a week, and a 'down' period for a couple of weeks. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate. The mood swings cause significant impairment in her social and academic life. While she has not had a full manic or major depressive episode, the cumulative effect is highly disruptive. |
| **Setting events:** | Poor sleep, high stress (e.g., university deadlines), use of recreational drugs or alcohol.
| **Triggers:** | The natural cycling of the disorder, but can be exacerbated by external stressors.
| **Risks:** | Academic failure, financial problems, relationship instability, development of Bipolar I or II Disorder.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The reinforcing nature of the hypomanic periods (high energy, creativity, confidence). The lack of a consistent routine. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

This is the first time Sophia has sought treatment for her mood instability.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Strong family history of bipolar disorder.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The stress and unstructured lifestyle of university.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** The instability in her routines (especially sleep) exacerbates the natural mood cycling.
*   **Protective factors:** Intelligence, creativity, insight that her moods are causing problems.

---

## Goals

*   To stabilize her mood and reduce the amplitude of her mood swings.
*   To establish a stable and healthy daily routine, particularly around sleep.
*   To develop skills for managing both hypomanic and depressive symptoms.
*   To make informed decisions about medication (mood stabilizers).

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Mood instability | - Engage in psychoeducation to understand Cyclothymia.<br>- Use daily mood monitoring to identify patterns and triggers.<br>- Implement strict sleep hygiene: consistent bedtimes and wake times, regardless of mood.<br>- Regulate other routines (e.g., meals, exercise).<br>- Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist to discuss mood stabilizers. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use mood monitoring and routine regulation. |
| **Rationale:** | To manage the underlying biological vulnerability by imposing external structure and routine. Regular sleep is one of the most effective strategies for preventing switches into hypomania or depression. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will help Sophia to create a simple daily mood chart where she can rate her mood, energy, and sleep. They will work together to create a realistic and achievable daily schedule. The focus is on consistency. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The experience of a more stable mood is the primary reinforcer. Seeing the connection between a late night and a subsequent mood swing on her chart will also increase her motivation to stick to the plan. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Relatively stable mood. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. Maintain the routine. |
| **Early Warning Signs (Hypomania):** Feeling more energetic, needing less sleep, thoughts racing, starting multiple new projects. | - This is a critical point. She must prioritize sleep. This may mean taking medication prescribed by her psychiatrist.<br>- Reduce stimulation (e.g., avoid parties, loud music).<br>- Stick to her routine rigidly. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.<br>- Channel the energy into finishing one project, not starting five new ones. |
| **Early Warning Signs (Depression):** Feeling low, wanting to withdraw, losing interest in activities. | - This is also a critical point. She must use behavioural activation.<br>- Stick to her routine rigidly, especially her wake-up time.<br>- Schedule a pleasant activity, even if she doesn't feel like it.<br>- Reach out to her support system. |
| **Escalation:** Clear hypomanic or depressive symptoms causing functional impairment. | - Contact her psychologist or psychiatrist.<br>- Her support people (e.g., family) can be prompted to remind her of the plan.<br>- A medication adjustment may be needed. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Making impulsive decisions in a hypomanic state or having suicidal thoughts in a depressive state. | - Implement the crisis plan.<br>- This may involve her support people taking temporary control of her finances.<br>- If there is a risk of harm, contact emergency services. |
| **De-escalation:** The mood episode begins to resolve. | - Focus on re-stabilizing her routine. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Review what triggered the episode and how the plan can be strengthened. |
