## About the Person

*   **All about me:** Robert is a retired librarian who has lived in his family home for 40 years. He is a widower and lives alone. He has a deep love for books, history, and knowledge.
*   **Strengths, skills and aspirations:** Robert is intelligent, articulate, and has a vast amount of knowledge on many subjects. He hopes to be able to have his grandchildren visit him in his home again.
*   **Relevant social history:** Robert's hoarding behaviour began to escalate after his wife passed away 10 years ago. He has become increasingly isolated over the years.
*   **Disability and health needs:** Robert has a diagnosis of Hoarding Disorder. He has persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them.
*   **Communication needs, choice and control:** Robert is very articulate but becomes defensive and distressed when the topic of his possessions is raised. A gentle, patient, and non-judgmental approach is essential. He needs to feel in control of all decisions.
*   **Routine:** His daily routine is unstructured. He spends most of his time at home, surrounded by his possessions.
*   **Sensory needs:** The sheer volume of clutter can be overwhelming, but he has adapted to it.
*   **Likes and dislikes:** Robert likes reading, watching historical documentaries, and talking about his past. He dislikes anyone touching or moving his things without his permission.

## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Excessive acquisition of and failure to discard a large number of possessions (mainly books, newspapers, and magazines). |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The behaviour is constant and ongoing. The clutter has accumulated over many years. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. The clutter compromises the use of living spaces. Pathways are narrow, the kitchen is unusable, and there are significant fire and trip hazards. |
| **Setting events:** | Loneliness, boredom, feelings of grief.
| **Triggers:** | Seeing free items (e.g., newspapers), visiting second-hand bookshops.
| **Risks:** | Fire hazard, trip and fall risk, poor hygiene, pest infestation, social isolation, eviction.
| **Maintaining factors:** | Emotional attachment to objects (e.g., as a link to his late wife), belief that items are valuable or will be useful one day, distress associated with making decisions about discarding. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Robert's daughter has made several attempts to help him 'clean up', which have resulted in significant distress and conflict. This is the first time he has agreed to professional support.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Family history of hoarding, grief and loss, perfectionistic traits.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The death of his wife.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Decision-making difficulties, emotional attachment to possessions, social isolation.
*   **Protective factors:** Supportive daughter, intelligence, his stated goal of having grandchildren visit.

---

## Goals

*   To improve the safety of the home environment by clearing pathways and reducing fire load.
*   To improve Robert's skills in decision-making, problem-solving, and categorizing possessions.
*   To reduce the excessive acquisition of new items.
*   To reconnect Robert with social or community activities.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Acquiring and not discarding | - Engage in regular sessions with an OT specializing in hoarding.<br>- Focus on harm reduction first (e.g., clearing a path to the exit).<br>- Do not touch or discard any items without Robert's explicit permission.<br>- Practice sorting and categorizing skills with non-threatening items first (e.g., junk mail).<br>- Establish a rule for new items (e.g., 'one in, one out'). |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use a structured decision-making model for sorting possessions. |
| **Rationale:** | To reduce the overwhelming feeling of being faced with thousands of decisions and to build confidence in his ability to let items go. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The OT will work with Robert using a motivational interviewing approach. They will develop a simple set of questions for him to ask himself about an object (e.g., 'Do I have room for this?', 'Have I used this in the last year?', 'Is it broken?'). They will practice this on one small pile at a time. |
| **Reinforcement:** | The feeling of accomplishment and reclaiming usable space is the primary reinforcer. Praise from the OT and his daughter for his hard work is also important. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Living in a cluttered but currently stable environment. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Becoming anxious or agitated during a sorting session. | - Take a break immediately.<br>- Shift the focus to a less threatening topic.<br>- Validate his distress ('I can see this is really difficult'). |
| **Escalation:** Refusing to continue, becoming angry or tearful. | - End the session for the day on a positive note if possible.<br>- Do not push him or get into an argument about the importance of an item. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Extreme distress, shutting down completely. | - Reassure him that he is in control and that nothing will be thrown out without his consent.<br>- Offer a cup of tea and a change of subject. |
| **De-escalation:** Calming down, able to talk again. | - Acknowledge how hard the process is.<br>- Do not try to immediately restart the sorting task. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - In the next session, review what made the last one so difficult.<br>- Break the task down into even smaller steps if needed. |
