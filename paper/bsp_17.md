## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Temper tantrums (e.g., screaming, throwing things), arguing with adults, deliberately annoying others. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | Occurs daily, multiple times per day. |
| **Intensity:** | Moderate to Severe. Tantrums can last for up to an hour and are very disruptive to the family and classroom. |
| **Setting events:** | Feeling tired, hungry, or bored. |
| **Triggers:** | Being asked to do something she doesn't want to do (e.g., homework, chores), not getting her own way. |
| **Risks:** | Damage to relationships with parents and peers, school difficulties. |
| **Maintaining factors:** | Gaining attention, avoiding non-preferred tasks, getting her own way. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Mia's oppositional behaviour has been a concern for her parents since she was a preschooler. They have recently sought help from a child psychologist and are starting a parent management training program.

---

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** Difficult temperament, possible genetic factors.
*   **Precipitating factors:** Demands, requests, limit setting.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Inconsistent discipline, parental stress, reinforcement of negative behaviour.
*   **Protective factors:** Strong family support, intelligence.

---

## Goals

*   To reduce the frequency and intensity of Mia's temper tantrums and defiant behaviours.
*   To improve Mia's compliance with adult requests.
*   To improve Mia's relationships with her parents and peers.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tantrums, arguing, defiance | - Parents to participate in a Parent Management Training (PMT) program.<br>- Use praise and positive attention for pro-social behaviour.<br>- Give clear, concise, and direct commands.<br>- Use a token economy or sticker chart to reward compliance.<br>- Provide predictable routines and warnings before transitions. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use 'calm down' strategies when she feels angry or frustrated. |
| **Rationale:** | To help her manage her strong emotions without resorting to tantrums. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | Mia's parents will teach her simple relaxation skills, such as taking deep 'belly breaths' or going to a 'calm down corner'. They will practice these skills with her when she is calm. |
| **Reinforcement:** | Praise and encouragement will be given for using her calm down strategies. |

---

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Calm and cooperative. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Whining, arguing, scowling. | - Use planned ignoring for minor misbehaviour.<br>- Prompt her to use her 'calm down' strategies.<br>- Offer a choice between two acceptable options. |
| **Escalation:** Yelling, refusing to follow instructions. | - Give a clear 'when... then' statement (e.g., 'When you have put your toys away, then you can watch TV').<br>- Use a calm, neutral tone of voice. |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Full-blown tantrum (screaming, throwing things). | - Ensure her safety and the safety of others.<br>- Use a planned time-out procedure. |
| **De-escalation:** Calming down, crying softly. | - Once calm, briefly explain why she had the consequence.<br>- Avoid lecturing or lengthy discussions. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Re-engage her in a positive activity.<br>- Look for opportunities to praise good behaviour. |
