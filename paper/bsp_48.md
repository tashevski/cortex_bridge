## Risks of Harm

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description of behaviour:** | Clinging and submissive behaviour, an inability to make decisions, and an urgent search for another relationship to replace the one that has ended. |
| **Frequency / Duration:** | The pattern is pervasive and lifelong. The acute distress and urgent search for a new relationship is most prominent following a breakup. |
| **Intensity:** | Severe. She is at risk of quickly entering into another unhealthy relationship where she may be exploited. Her inability to function independently is profound. |
| **Setting events:** | The end of a relationship.
| **Triggers:** | Having to make a decision on her own, being alone for an evening.
| **Risks:** | Becoming involved in an abusive relationship, being financially exploited, severe depression and anxiety when left alone.
| **Maintaining factors:** | The temporary reduction in anxiety when someone else takes responsibility. Her core belief that she is unable to function on her own. |

### History of Behaviour and Intervention

Wendy has never had therapy before. She has always seen her behaviour as being part of a loving and devoted partnership.

## Why the Behaviour Occurs

*   **Predisposing factors:** An innate anxious temperament, a cultural or family background that encourages passivity in women.
*   **Precipitating factors:** The loss of a caregiving relationship.
*   **Perpetuating factors:** Her submissive behaviour tends to attract dominant partners, which reinforces her dependent role. Her avoidance of independence prevents her from learning she can cope.
*   **Protective factors:** She is intelligent and has a genuine capacity for warmth and caring.

---

## Goals

*   To increase her independence and self-reliance.
*   To improve her ability to make everyday decisions.
*   To help her to remain single for a period of time to build her own sense of self.
*   To learn to identify and assert her own needs and opinions.

## Proactive Strategies

| Behaviour | Proactive Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dependence and submission | - Engage in long-term therapy, focusing on assertiveness training and building self-esteem.<br>- Practice making small, independent decisions every day.<br>- Schedule activities that she must do on her own.<br>- Explore her own interests and preferences through trying new things. |

---

## Skill Development

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skill:** | To use assertiveness skills to express her own needs and opinions. |
| **Rationale:** | To help her move from a passive communication style to one where she can respectfully state her own views, wants, and boundaries, which is a core component of independent functioning. |
| **Teaching Strategy:** | The psychologist will teach Wendy the difference between passive, aggressive, and assertive communication. They will use role-playing to practice specific scenarios (e.g., a friend asks to borrow money, a colleague asks her to do their work). She will learn and rehearse specific assertive phrases (e.g., 'I'm not able to do that', 'I would prefer to go to the other movie'). |
| **Reinforcement:** | The sense of self-respect and empowerment that comes from successfully asserting herself. Praise from the therapist for her efforts. |

## Response Strategies

| What this looks like | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline:** Attending therapy, practicing new skills. | Refer to the proactive strategies section. |
| **Early Warning Signs:** Feeling intense anxiety about an upcoming decision, asking multiple people for their opinion. | - This is a crucial practice opportunity.<br>- The therapist (and eventually Wendy herself) should prompt her to make the decision on her own, even if it's a 'mistake'.<br>- Remind her that the goal is to build the decision-making muscle, not to make the 'perfect' choice. |
| **Escalation:** Becoming highly distressed or panicked when left alone or when faced with a major decision. | - Use anxiety management techniques (e.g., deep breathing, mindfulness).<br>- Validate the fear ('I know this feels terrifying right now') but also the belief in her ability to cope ('but I believe you can get through this'). |
| **Peak of Escalation:** Frantically contacting people, agreeing to go on a date with someone unsuitable out of a desperate need not to be alone. | - Her support system (e.g., a trusted friend who is aware of her goals) can gently remind her of her plan to stay single for a while.<br>- The natural consequences of a poor decision are part of the learning process. |
| **De-escalation:** The panic subsides. | - Praise her for getting through the period of intense anxiety. |
| **Recovery:** Returning to baseline. | - Process the incident in therapy. What did she learn about her ability to cope? What would she do differently next time? |
