It's understandable that you're using the word \"complex\" to describe it. \n\nTo help me understand what's on your mind and offer some support, could you tell me a little more about what aspects of existence are feeling particularly complex right now? \n\nPerhaps you could consider:\n\n* **What specifically about existence is causing you to feel this way?** (e.g., meaning, purpose, mortality, the universe, your place in it?)\n* **What thoughts or feelings are arising when you think about existence?** (e.g., anxiety, wonder, confusion, a sense of lack?)\n* **What are you hoping to understand or find through exploring these questions?** (e.g., meaning, peace, clarity?)\n\nEven just a few words about what's bringing this up would be a helpful starting point.
